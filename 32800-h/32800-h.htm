<h2>THE EXTINCT.</h2>


<p>If it is a scene of painful interest, as surely it is to a
well-constituted mind, to stand by and watch the death-struggles
of one of the nobler brutes,&mdash;a dog or an elephant,
for example,&mdash;to mark the failing strength, the
convulsive throes, the appealing looks, the sobs and sighs,
the rattling breath, the glazing eye, the stiffening limbs&mdash;how
much more exciting is the interest with which we
watch the passing away of a dying species. For species
have their appointed periods as well as individuals: viewed
in the infinite mind of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the Creator, from the standpoint
of eternity, each form, each race, had its proper
duration assigned to it&mdash;a duration which, doubtless,
varied in the different species as greatly as that assigned
to the life of one individual animal differs from that
assigned to the life of another. As the elephant or the
eagle may survive for centuries, while the horse and the
dog scarcely reach to twenty years, and multitudes of
insects are born and die within a few weeks, so one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>species may have assigned to its life, for aught I know, a
hundred thousand years as its normal period, and another
not more than a thousand. If creation was, with respect
to the species, what I have elsewhere proved it was with
respect to the individual,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;a violent irruption into the
cycle of life&mdash;then we may well conceive this to have taken
place at very varying relative periods in the life-history
of the different species;&mdash;that is to say, that at a given date,
(viz., that of creation) one species might be just completing,
<i>ideally</i>, its allotted course, another just commencing, and
a third attaining its meridian.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that not a few species of animals have
died during the present constitution of things. Races,
which we know on indubitable evidence to have existed
during the dominion of man, have died out, have become
extinct, so that not a single individual survives. The
entire totality of individuals which constituted the species,
have, in these cases, ceased to be. Some of these seem
to have died at a very early era of human history; but
others at a comparatively recent period, and some even
within our own times. Even within the last twenty years
several animals have been taken, of which it is highly probable
that not a single representative remains on the earth;
while there are others yet again, which we know to be
reduced to a paucity so extreme, that their extinction can
scarcely be delayed more than a few years at most. Thus
we may consider ourselves as standing by the dying-beds
of these creatures, with the consciousness that we shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>soon see them no more; that the sentence is gone forth
against them; that their sands are running to the last
grains, and that no effort of ours can materially prolong
their existence. The facts from which these conclusions
are drawn are highly curious, and I shall endeavour to
lay them, with as much brevity as they will allow, before
my readers.</p>

<p>On that prochronic hypothesis, by which alone, as I
conceive, the facts revealed by geological investigation
can be reconciled with the unerring statements of Scripture,&mdash;every
word of which is truth, the truth of a "God
that cannot lie,"&mdash;we may assume the actual creation of
this earth to have taken place at that period which is
geologically known as the later Tertiary Era, or thereabout.
When, on the third day, "the waters under the heaven
were gathered together into one place, and the dry land
appeared," it is not necessary to suppose that the form
assumed by the emerging land was immediately that which
it now has; we may, on the other hand, I think, assume
as likely, that successive or continuous changes of elevation
followed, which have been protracted, perhaps constantly
decreasing in extent and force, to the present hour.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps between the six days' work of Creation and
the Noachic Flood, Europe became much altered in outline,
and in elevation. It may have been, at first, a great
archipelago, agreeing with the epithet by which it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
designated in early Scripture, "the Isles,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and by which
it was subsequently known for ages. The Pyrenees, the
Alps, and the Apennines, already emerged, were slowly
uniting, and the Carpathians, the Balkan, the Taurus, and
the Caucasus, were uprearing, while the vast regions to
the north were still an expanse of open sea. England
was probably united with the newly-formed European
continent, and embraced Ireland in one great mass of
unbroken land, which stretched far away into the Atlantic.
Volcanoes were active in the north of Ireland, and in the
west of Scotland, pouring forth those floods of fiery lava
which have cooled into the columnar forms seen at the
Giant's Causeway and the Cave of Fingal. Slowly the
north of Europe emerged, and the great south-west
expanse of Britain sank beneath the sea, leaving, it may
be, the large island of Atlantis in mid-ocean, to be submerged
by a later catastrophe.</p>

<p>Probably changes very similar were coevally taking
place in Asia and North America, while the vast flat
alluvial regions of South America were, perhaps, even
still more recently formed, and a great Pacific continent
was in course of subsidence, of which Australasia and
Polynesia are the existing remains.</p>

<p>Such changes of elevation, and of the continuity of
land, must effect considerable alterations of climate; and,
therefore, it is not surprising to know that, in earliest
ages, animals and plants flourished in regions to which
they would now be altogether unfitted, and that many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
races existed then which have since died out; for geological
and climatal modifications are among the most
easily conceivable causes of the decease of species.</p>

<p>In the great swamps of emerging Germany, and in the,
as yet, only half-drained valleys of Switzerland, lurked
then the heavy Dinothere. Huger than the hugest elephant,
he carried an enormous body of twenty feet in
length, vast and barrel-like, which even his columnar
limbs of ten feet long scarcely sufficed to raise from the
ground. His uncouth head, elephantine in shape, was furnished
with a short proboscis; and two tusks, short and
strong, projected from the lower jaw, not curving upward,
as in the elephant, but downward, as in the walrus. In
the teeming marshes lurked this ungainly beast, half immersed,
digging out with his mighty pickaxe-tusks the
succulent roots that permeated the soft soil, which his
sensitive trunk picked up, and conveyed to his mouth.</p>

<p>On the southern slopes of the slowly-rising Himalayas,
already clothed with forests of teak, and palm, and bamboo,
revelled the Sivathere, another heavy creature, of the
bulk of a rhinoceros, and therefore not more than half
equalling the German colossus. He too was a strange
subject. With a proportionally enormous head, in form
somewhat between that of the elephant and of the rhinoceros,
minute sunken piggish eyes, and a short proboscis
like that of the tapir, he carried two pairs of dissimilar
horns. On the forehead were placed one pair, seated upon
bony cores, not unlike those of our short-horn oxen. Behind
these there rose another pair, large and massive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
which were palmated and branching, like those of the
fallow-deer, but on a gigantic scale. What sort of a
body, and what kind of limbs, furnished the complement
of this curiously-compound head, we do not exactly know;
but surely it must have been a very remarkable form, as
it browsed quietly and blamelessly, among the luxuriant
shrubs of those sun-facing slopes.</p>

<p>In the same regions a land Tortoise of enormous bulk,
far vaster than the vastest of now existing species, to
which that ponderous one which will march merrily away
with a ton weight on its back, is a mere pigmy, shook the
earth with its waddle, and the forests with its hoarse
bellowing. Broad roads, like our highways, were beaten
by it through the jungle, along which it periodically
travelled to the cool springs, leisurely sauntering, and
tarrying to munch the fleshy gourds and cactuses that
bordered its self-made track.</p>

<p>The plains of Siberia, stretching away towards the
Arctic Ocean, sheltered countless hosts of huge pachydermatous
quadrupeds. A species of Rhinoceros, not less
bulky than those of the present age, roamed to the very
verge of the Icy Sea; its hide, tough and leathery, was
destitute of folds, but was clothed with tufts of rigid
gray hair,&mdash;an ornament which is denied to our existing
degenerates. Two horns, the front one of unusual massiveness
and length, were seated, as in several of the African
kinds, one behind the other, and were wielded by a head
of great strength and development.</p>

<p>More remarkable still was that great hairy Elephant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
called the Mammoth, which appears to have swarmed in
those cold plains by myriads. Of equal dimensions to
the Indian species of the present age, this denizen of the
north had far more enormous curving tusks, and instead
of the naked hide of those we are familiar with, his body
was encased in black hair, with a thick under stratum of
red curled wool, and bore a long mane on the ridge of the
neck.</p>

<p>There was, at the same time, a quadruped, nearly allied
to the elephants, but differing from them in some technical
characters. With a body equally bulky, but considerably
longer, it had shorter limbs, a broader head, small tusks
in the lower, as well as large curving ones in the upper
jaw, and probably a trunk intermediate between the
elephant's and the tapir's. Truly cosmopolite as this great
Mastodon was, for we dig up his bones from all parts of
the world, he had his head-quarters in North America,
where, from his dimensions and his numbers, he must
have formed a very characteristic feature of the primeval
swamps and forests. There, with his tusks, he grubbed
up the young trees, whose juicy roots he ground down
with his great mammillary molar teeth, or chewed up to
a pulp the sapwood of the recent branches and spicy
twigs. And ever and anon he would resort to the broad
saline marshes,&mdash;the "Licks," as they are now called,&mdash;to
lick up the crystallised salt on their margins, so grateful to
all herbivorous quadrupeds. Here, in his eagerness to
gratify his palate with the pungent condiment, he would
press farther and farther into the treacherous quagmire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
till he began to sink, and then, in his terror, he would
plunge and flounder, getting more and more deeply bemired,
till at length he could struggle no more, and the
bog would close over him, and he would be no more seen
till some spectacled geologist of this nineteenth century,
note-book in hand, would go and dig up his remains,
marvelling at the freshness with which they had been
preserved in the antiseptic peat.</p>

<p>But let us look at South America, where, as the great
back-bone chain of the Andes is being elevated out of the
sea, the torrents and cataracts are pouring down from its
sides immense quantities of crumbled rock and pasty mud,
which, deposited upon the vast tabular field, brought by
the upheaving just to the level of the sea, forms that
grand alluvial plain unequalled on the face of the globe
for extent, which is clothed with the mighty forests of
Guiana and Brazil, or with the tall grass and thistles of
the Pampas. The torrents still fall; and, meandering
through this glorious plain, unite and form the most
majestic of rivers, ever depositing the rich alluvium, and
thus sensibly augmenting, to this day, the breadth of their
noble continent, and their own length.</p>

<p>Strange creatures riot here in these primal ages. The
young land, hot and moist,&mdash;moist with the unevaporated
water of the depositing rivers, and hot with the influence
of the submarine volcano which is lifting it, as well as
with the beams of the tropical sun,&mdash;brings forth from its
steaming bosom, the most gigantic trees in the most profuse
luxuriance. And animal life teems too, in this riant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
vegetation. Millions of insects,&mdash;ants, and termites, and
beetles,&mdash;are busy at work upon the trunks of the great
trees, eating them down, and swarming in their immense
populous nests, beyond all imaginings. Surely they will
soon eat up the entire forest, dense and rapid as it grows,
and there will be nothing left but cities of insects. No
fear! See those great waddling beasts<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with stout short
legs, and enormous hoof-like claws so bent inward that
the creatures are obliged to walk on the edge of their
paws,&mdash;they are equally busy with the insects, tearing
apart with their powerful claws the earthy nests as fast as
they are built, and devouring the makers themselves by
wholesale. Here is a wonderful creature, a vast armadillo,
with a body as big as a rhinoceros, covered with a
convex oval shield, formed of hexagonal plates accurately
fitted to each other. See how he approaches a fallen tree,
which his unerring instinct tells him is perforated through
and through, and filled with the swarming millions of ants;
with his powerful jaws he munches up the entire mass;
the thin and papery partitions of the dusty wood are
ground to powder, and the ants are licked in and chewed
into a black pulp between those curious cylinders of
teeth.</p>

<p>But lo! here are mightier creatures yet! See the vast
Mylodon, the Scelidothere, and the still more colossal
Megathere. Ponderous giants these! The very forests
seem to tremble under their stately stride. Their immense
bulk preponderates behind, terminating in a tail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of wonderful thickness and solidity: the head is mean
and awakens no terror; the eye lacks lustre and threatens
no violence, though the whole form betokens vast power,
and the stout limbs are terminated by the same stout,
inbent, sharp hoof-claws. One of them approaches that
wide-spreading locust-tree; he gazes up at the huge mud-brown
structures that resemble hogsheads affixed to the
forks of the branches, and he knows that the luscious
termites are filling them to overflowing. His lips water
at the tempting sight; have them he must. But how?
that heavy sternpost of his was never made for climbing;
yet see! he rears himself up against the tree; is he about
to essay the scaling? Not he: he knows his powers
better. He gives it one embrace; one strong hug; as if
to test its thickness and hold upon the earth. Now he is
digging away below, scooping out the soft soil from between
the roots,&mdash;and it is marvellous to note how rapidly
he lays them bare with those great shovel-like claws of his.
Now he rears himself again; straddles wide on his hind
feet, fixing the mighty claws deep in the ground; plants
himself firmly on his huge tail, as on the third foot of a
tripod, and once more grasps the tree. The enormous
hind quarters, the limbs and the loins, the broad pelvis,
the thick spinal cord supplying abundant nervous energy
to the swelling muscles, inserted in the ridged and
keeled bones, all come into play, as a <i>point d'appui</i> for
the Herculean effort. "And now conceive the massive
frame of the Megathere convulsed with the mighty
wrestling, every vibrating fibre reacting upon its bony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
attachment with the force of a hundred giants: extraordinary
must be the strength and proportions of the
tree, if, when rocked to and fro, to right and left, in such
an embrace, it can long withstand the efforts of its
assailant."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It yields; the roots fly up; the earth is
scattered wide upon the surrounding foliage; the tree
comes down with a thundering crash, cracking and snapping
the great boughs like glass; the frightened insects
swarm out at every orifice; but the huge beast is in
upon them; with his sharp hoofs he tears apart the
crusty walls of the earth-nests, and licks out their living
contents, fat pup&aelig;, eggs and all, rolling down the sweet
morsels, half sucking, half chewing, with a delighted
gusto that repays him for all his mighty toil.</p>

<p>While the heavy giant is absorbed in his juicy breakfast,
see, there lounges along his neighbour, the Macrauchen.
Equally massive, equally heavy, equally vast, equally
peaceful, the stranger resembles a huge rhinoceros elevated
on much loftier limbs; but his most remarkable feature
is an enormously long neck, like that of the camel, but
carried to the altitude of that of the giraffe. Thus he
thrusts his great muzzle into the very centre of the
leafy trees, and gathering with his prehensile and flexible
lip the succulent twigs and foliage, he too finds abundance
of food for his immense body, in the teeming vegetation,
without intruding upon the supply of his fellows.</p>

<p>And what enormous mass is suddenly thrust up out of
the quiet water of yonder igarip&eacute;? A hoarse, hollow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
grunt, as it comes up, tells us that it is alive, and now we
discern that it is the head of an animal&mdash;the Toxodon.
Half hidden as it is under the shadow of the fan-palms,
and the broad, arrowy leaves of the great arums that grow
out of the lake, we see the little piggish eyes, set far up
in the great head, and wide apart, peeping with a curious
union of stupidity and shrewdness; the immense muzzle
and lips; the broad cheeks armed with stiff projecting
bristles; and, as the creature opens its cavernous mouth
to seize a floating gourd, an extraordinary array of
incurving teeth, strangely bowed so as to make a series
of arches of immense power. Now, with his strong front
teeth, he tears up the great fleshy arum-roots from the
clay of the bank, and grinds them to pulp; and now,
with another grunt, the vast bristly head sinks beneath
the water, and we see it no more. Hundreds of other
creatures are straying around,&mdash;sloths, bats, and monkeys,
and birds of gay plumage, on the trees; ant-eaters and
cavies, lizards and snakes, on the ground; butterflies and
humming-birds hovering in the air; tapirs and turtles and
crocodiles in the waters;&mdash;but these are matters of course:&mdash;we
are only thinking of such as have passed away and
left no descendants to perpetuate their forms to our own
times.</p>

<p>Away to the great Austral land&mdash;in our day minished
to the insular Australia and New Zealand and a few satellite
isles&mdash;but then, in the morning of creation, possibly
stretching far to the north and on either hand, so as to
include the scattered groups of Polynesia in one great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
continent, and even to reach so far as Madagascar on the
west. This was the region of gigantic fowls, and of
marsupial quadrupeds. Kangaroos of eight or nine feet
in stature leaped over the primeval bush, and wombats
and dasyures of elephantine bulk burrowed in the hill
sides, and great lion-like beasts prowled about the plains.
But surely the most characteristic feature of the scene
was impressed by the birds! Vast struthious birds,
which would have looked down with supreme contempt
on the loftiest African ostrich, whose limb-bones greatly
exceeded in bulk those of our dray horses, whose three-toed
feet made a print in the clay some eighteen inches
long, and whose proud heads commanded the horizon
from an elevation of twelve feet above the ground,&mdash;terrible
birds, whose main development of might was in
the legs and feet, being utterly destitute of the least trace
of wings&mdash;these strode swiftly about the rank ferny
brakes, possessing a conscious power of defence in the
back stroke of their muscular feet, and fearless of man or
beast, mainly nocturnal in their activity, concealing themselves
by day in the recesses of the dense forests, where
the majestic trees were interwoven with cable-like climbers,
or couching in the midst of tall reeds and aroideous
plants that margined the great swampy lakes of these
regions.</p>

<p>But what of our own land? What of these distant isles
of the Gentiles in that early day, when the enterprising
sons of Cain, migrating from the already straitened land
of Nod, were pushing their advancing columns, with arts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and arms, in all directions over the young earth? Did
any of them reach to the as yet insular Europe, settling
themselves along the margins of its deep gulfs and draining
basins? Perhaps they did, and even explored the
utmost limits of the great Atlantic island, on the remains
of which we live. What did they find here? A land of
mountain and valley, of plain and down, of lake and
river, of bog and fell, of forest and field, in some features
much as now: where the oak, and elm, and ash covered
great tracts, and the birch and fir clothed the hills; but
where the yew and the laurel grew side by side with the
custard-apple and the fan-palm, and the ground was overrun
with trailers of the gourd and melon kind, but where
grasses were few and scarce, the exquisite order <i>Rosace&aelig;</i>,
with its beautiful flowers and grateful fruit, was rarely
seen, and the aromatic <i>Labiat&aelig;</i>&mdash;the thyme, and mint,
and sage&mdash;were as yet unknown.</p>

<p>And the beasts that already tenanted this fair land
were for bulk and power worthy of the domain. The
Dinothere and the Mastodon wallowed and browsed where
great London now crowds its princely palaces. Through
the greenwood shades of the forests of oak wandered
hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses of several kinds, the
long-tusked mammoth, and two or three species of horses.
Two gigantic oxen&mdash;a bison and a urus&mdash;roamed over
the fir-clad hills of Scotland, and a curious flat-headed ox,
of small size and minute horns, made Ireland its peculiar
home. That island, too, was the metropolis of a colossal
fallow-deer, whose remains, ticketed as those of the Irish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Elk, astonish us in our museums. It stood seven feet in
height at the withers, and waved its branching antlers,
eleven feet wide, twelve feet and upwards above the
ground;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> yet its magnificent stature could not preserve
it from a not infrequent fate, that of becoming intombed
in the deep bogs of its native isle. Britain had, moreover,
a stag of scarcely less gigantic proportions, with the reindeer
of the north, and the smaller kinds with which we
are now familiar.</p>

<p>All these herbivores, and numberless smaller genera,
some now extinct, some surviving, were kept in check by
powerful predatory tyrants, for whose representatives we
must now look to the jungles of India or the burning
karroos of Southern Africa. The Lion and the Tiger
stalked over these isles, and a terrible tiger-like creature,
the Machairode, of even superior size and power to the
scourge of the Bengal jungle, with curved and saw-edged
canine-teeth, hung upon the flanks of the cervine and
bovine herds, and sprang upon the fattest of them. Then,
too, there was a vast Bear, huger and mightier than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
fearful grizzly bear of America, which haunted caves,
and prowling around forced down with its horrid paws
the shaggy bull, and broke his stout neck by main force,
and dragged the body home to devour at leisure. And
many of these caves, the holes and chasms of the limestone
districts, were inhabited by a gigantic species of Hyena,
which seems to have existed in great numbers, so that
the caverns are strewn all over, from end to end, with
thousands of teeth and disjointed bones, both of the
hyenas themselves and of the other carnivores; shewing
that there they lived and died in successive generations;
and, mainly, of other creatures, of very varied species,
great and small, most of them cracked, and crushed, and
gnawed, shewing the plain marks of the powerful conical
teeth of those obscene nocturnal animals.</p>

<p>Thus I have endeavoured to draw a picture, vague and
imperfect, I know, of some of the more remarkable and
prominent features of the primeval earth, limiting the
sketch to those forms which we know only by their fossil
remains. In endeavouring to paint their contour and
general appearance, and still more their habits and instincts,
conjecture must be largely at work&mdash;a conjecture,
however, which takes for its basis the anatomical
exigencies of the osseous structure, and the analogy of
existing creatures the most nearly related to the fossil.</p>

<p>These forms, many of them so huge and uncouth, are
well known as having tenanted various regions of the
earth during what is known as the Tertiary Era, in its
later periods. They certainly do not exist in those regions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
now. When did their life&mdash;their species-life&mdash;terminate?
I have been assuming that they were upon the earth, as
living sentient beings, in the earliest age of what we call
the historic period&mdash;that is, according to the chronology
of the Word of God, which must be true, within the last
six thousand years. This assumption is so heterodox,
that unsupported by evidence, it would be generally rejected;
let us then inquire what evidence there is that
man was an inhabitant of the globe contemporaneously
with these huge giants of the bestial creation.</p>

<p>I do not pretend to offer positive evidence concerning
the synchronism of <i>all</i> the animals I have been describing
with man; but, as there is no doubt that they were all
contemporaneous, <i>inter se</i>, if we can attain to good
grounds for concluding his co-existence with <i>some</i> of
them, it may be no unfair presumption that the case was
so with the others.</p>

<p>And first, with respect to the <i>Colossochelys Atlas</i>, that
vast fossil land tortoise of the Sewalik hills, in the north
of India, whose carapace may have covered an area of
twelve or fifteen feet in diameter, and whose entire length,
as in walking, when head and tail were protruded, could
not have been much less than thirty feet. The discoverers
of this interesting relic, Dr Falconer and Major
Cauntley, have discussed the question of its probable
cessation of existence with some care; and they have come
to the conclusion "that there are fair grounds for entertaining
the belief, as probable, that the <i>Colossochelys Atlas</i>
may have lived down to an early period of the human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
epoch, and become extinct since." This they infer on
two grounds: first, from the fact that, in the same strata,
which are not limited to the Sewalik hills, but extend,
with the remains of this immense tortoise, all over the
great Indian area, from Ava to the Gulf of Cambay, other
tortoises, crocodiles, &amp;c., which were contemporary with
the <i>Colossochelys</i>, have survived to the present time; and,
secondly, from mythologic and cosmogonic traditions of
many eastern nations, having reference to a tortoise of
such gigantic size as to be associated in the current
fables with an elephant.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Elian, the Greek naturalist, quoting Megasthenes, a
still older authority, who resided several years in India,
and who collected a good deal of interesting information
concerning the country, reports that in the sea around
Ceylon there were found tortoises of such enormous
dimensions that huts were made of their shells, each shell
being fifteen cubits (or twenty-two feet) long; so that
several people were able to find comfortable shelter under
it from the rain and sun.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And both Strabo and Pliny<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
assert that the Chelonophagi, who inhabited the shores of
the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, converted the enormous
shells of the turtles which they caught into roofs for their
houses and boats for their little voyages. It has been
suggested that the <i>Colossochelys</i> may have given origin
to these statements; but I rather think the great sea-turtles
of the genus <i>Chelone</i> are referred to, the convex
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>shells of which are known in our own day to reach to a
length of eight feet or upwards.</p>

<p>The circumstances attending the discovery of the
rhinoceros and elephant of Siberia are very curious and
interesting; since of them we have not the fossilised
skeletons, but the carcases preserved in a fresh state, as if
just dead, with (in one case) the flesh upon the bones in
an eatable state, and actually forming the food of dogs
and wolves, the skin entire, and covered with fur, and
even the eyes so perfectly preserved that the pupils could
be distinctly seen.</p>

<p>In 1771, in the frozen gravelly soil of Wilhuji, in the
northern part of Siberia, an animal was found partially
exposed. It was twelve feet in length; its body was enveloped
in a skin which had the thickness and firmness
of sole-leather, but was destitute of folds. Short hair,
strongly planted in the pores of the skin, grew on the face
in tufts; it was rigid in texture, and of a grey hue, with
here and there a black bristle, larger and stiffer than the
rest. Short ash-grey hair was observed to clothe the
legs, in moderate profusion. The eyelids and eyelashes
were still visible; the remains of the brain were still in
the cavity of the skull, and the flesh of the body, in a
putrefying condition, was still beneath the skin. On the
nose there were indications of a horn having been seated,
around which the integument had formed a sort of fold.</p>

<p>Thus the creature was known to be a Rhinoceros, and
the head and feet were lifted, and conveyed to St Petersburg,
where they are still preserved in the Imperial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Museum. Men of science soon remarked that in very
many points this specimen differed from any species now
known; and, indeed, a hairy rhinoceros was, in itself, an
anomaly. Subsequent investigations have revealed that
the same species, known as <i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>, inhabited
Siberia in great numbers, and is now extinct.</p>

<p>Nearly thirty years afterwards a still more interesting
revelation occurred. The shores of the Icy Ocean had
yielded a vast number of tusks, not distinguishable from
those of the known elephants, and capable of being
worked up by ivory-manufacturers, so that they occupied
a well-recognised place in the commercial markets, and
they constitute to this day the principal supply of the
Russian ivory-turners. A fisherman living at the mouth
of the Lena, being one day engaged in collecting tusks,
saw among some ice-blocks an uncouth object. The next
year he observed it still further exposed, and in the following
season, 1801, he saw that it was an enormous
animal, having great tusks, one of which, with the entire
side of the carcase, projected from the frozen mass. He
knew it to be a <i>Mammoth</i>, for so the fossil elephants were
called, and observed it with interest. The next season
was so cold that no change took place; but in 1803, the
melting of the ice proceeded so far that the gigantic
animal fell down from the cliff entire, and was deposited
on the sand beneath. The following season the fisherman,
Schumachoff, cut out the tusks, which he sold for
fifty rubles, and two years after this the scene was visited
by Mr Adams, in the service of the Imperial Court, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
has given an interesting account of his observations,
made, it must be remembered, in the seventh year after
the first discovery:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I found the Mammoth," observes this gentleman,
"still in the same place, but altogether mutilated ...
the Jakutski of the neighbourhood having cut off the
flesh, with which they fed their dogs during the scarcity.
Wild beasts, such as white bears, wolves, wolverines, and
foxes, also fed upon it, and the traces of their footsteps
were seen around. The skeleton, almost entirely devoid
of its flesh, remained whole, with the exception of one
fore-leg. The head was covered with a dry skin; one of
the ears, well preserved, was furnished with a tuft of hairs.
All these parts have necessarily been injured in transporting
them a distance of 7330 miles (to St Petersburg);
but the eyes have been preserved, and the pupil of one
can still be distinguished.</p>

<p>"The Mammoth was a male, with a long mane on the
neck. The tail and proboscis were not preserved. The
skin, of which I possess three-fourths, is of a dark-grey
colour, covered with reddish wool and black hairs; but
the dampness of the spot, where it had lain so long, had
in some degree destroyed the hair. The entire carcase,
of which I collected the bones on the spot, was nine feet
four inches high, and sixteen feet four inches long, without
including the tusks, which measured nine feet six
inches along the curve. The distance from the base or
root of the tusk to the point is three feet seven inches.
The two tusks together weighed three hundred and sixty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
pounds, English weight, and the head alone four hundred
and fourteen pounds.</p>

<p>"I next detached the skin of the side on which the
animal had lain, which was well preserved. This skin
was of such extraordinary weight that ten persons found
difficulty in transporting it to the shore. After this I dug
the ground in different places, to ascertain whether any
of its bones were buried, but principally to collect all the
hairs which the white bears had trod into the ground while
devouring the flesh. Although this was difficult from
the want of instruments, I succeeded in collecting more
than a pood (thirty-six pounds) of hair. In a few days the
work was completed, and I found myself in possession of
a treasure which amply recompensed me for the fatigues
and dangers of the journey, and the considerable expenses
of the enterprise.... The escarpment of ice was thirty-five
to forty toises high; and, according to the report of the
Tungusians, the animal was, when they first saw it, seven
toises below the surface of the ice, &amp;c. On arriving with
the Mammoth at Borchaya, our first care was to separate
the remaining flesh and ligaments from the bones, which
were then packed up. When I arrived at the Jakutsk, I
had the good fortune to repurchase the tusks, and from
thence expedited the whole to St Petersburg. The skeleton
is now in the Museum of the Academy, and the skin still
remains attached to the head and feet. A part of the
skin, and some of the hair of this animal were sent by
Mr Adams to Sir Joseph Banks, who presented them to
the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. The hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
is entirely separated from the skin, excepting in one very
small part, where it still remains attached. It consists of
two sorts, common hair and bristles, and of each there are
several varieties, differing in length and thickness. That
remaining fixed on the skin is of the colour of the camel,
an inch and a-half long, very thick-set, and curled in
locks. It is interspersed with a few bristles about three
inches long, of a dark-reddish colour. Among the separate
parcels of hair are some rather redder than the short
hair just mentioned, about four inches; and some bristles
nearly black, much thicker than horse hair, and from twelve
to eighteen inches long. The skin, when first brought to
the Museum, was offensive; it is now quite dry and hard,
and where most compact, is half-an-inch thick. Its colour
is the dull black of the living elephants."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>To me this narrative possesses an intense interest, and
I have gazed with great curiosity on the bit of dried and
blackened leather that is preserved in the Museum in
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, knowing it to have presented the
primal freshness of life within the present century. I
cannot help thinking that both the rhinoceros and this
elephant roamed over the plains of Siberia, not only since
the creation of man, but even since the Deluge. The
freshness of their state shews that the freezing up of their
carcases must have been sudden, and immediate upon
death. What supposition so natural as that, perhaps in a
blinding snowstorm, they slipped into a crevice in the ice-cliff,
were snowed up instantly, and thus preserved by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
antiseptic power of frost to this age? The glaciers of the
north may hold multitudes more of these and kindred
creatures, some of which may yet be disinterred, or thawed
out, and may lift yet more the curtain which so tantalisingly
covers the conditions of their life-history. These
two huge Pachyderms are certainly extinct now; yet their
remains, scattered over so vast an area, are everywhere
associated with those of other animals which were indubitably
contemporary with them, and whose species-life
is continued to our own times. Some of these, as the
great bear and the musk-ox of the sub-polar regions, we
know to be in the habit of migrating northward in spring,
and southward in autumn. That no lack of suitable food
would be found, even in such high latitudes, for browsing
quadrupeds, appears from the fact that, even beyond the
parallel of 75&deg; north, large birch-trees are found embedded
in the cliffs, in abundance sufficient to be largely used as
common fuel, and still retaining their woody fibre, their
bark, branches, and roots. The climate then was not
<i>greatly</i> different from what it is now, when the birch, as
a tree, reaches to about 70&deg;.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that both this elephant and
this rhinoceros were inhabitants of England also; and that
at the same period as the cavern bear, the hyena, the lion,
and the machairode, the baboon, the bison, and the urus,
the Irish elk, and the extinct horse; at the same time too,
as the rein-deer, the stag, the black bear, the wolf and
fox, the beaver, the wild cat, the hare, and rabbit, the
otter and badger, the wild hog, the rat and mouse, all our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
present shrews, the mole, the stoat and polecat, the noctule
and the horse-shoe bats. And curious it is to note, as we
go over this list, how some of the creatures enumerated
are long extinct everywhere, some have been long extinct
in England, but are still found elsewhere, some have more
recently become extinct here, but at different eras, some
are nearly extinguished, and some are yet abundant in
different degrees.</p>

<p>I do not attach much importance to the traditions of
the Siberians, that the tusks and skeletons which they
find belonged to a large subterraneous animal, which
could not bear the light; nor to those of the Chinese,
respecting a similar burrowing quadruped of prodigious
bulk, which they call, by a sort of irony, <i>tyn-schu</i>, or the
mouse that hides himself. The fables may have easily
been formed from the observation of the fossil bones, and
do not necessarily imply any memory of the living original.</p>

<p>The two examples of the exhumation of <i>Pachydermata</i>
in a fresh state, which I have given in detail, are by
no means the only cases that have occurred. It is the
universally-received belief throughout Siberia, that Mammoths
have been found with the flesh quite fresh and
filled with blood; probably meaning that the animal
juices flowed when thawed. Isbrand Ides mentions a
head on which the flesh, in a decaying state, was present;
and a frozen leg, as large as the body of a man; and
Jean Bernhard M&uuml;ller speaks of a tusk, the cavity of
which was filled with a substance which resembled coagulated
blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, in the voyage of Sarytschew, particulars are
given of the discovery of a Mammoth on the banks of the
Alaseia, a river which flows into the Arctic Ocean, beyond
the Indigirska. It had been dislodged by a flood, and
somewhat injured; but the carcase was still almost entire,
and was covered with the skin, to which in some places
long hair remained attached.</p>

<p>These statements might reasonably have been esteemed
either fables or gross exaggerations, but for the subsequent
discovery of the rhinoceros and elephant whose
remains have been brought to Europe. Read in the light
of these accounts, the earlier stories take the dignity of
authentic history; and it is interesting to note how well
these details agree with those observed by the accurate
Adams;&mdash;the long hair, for example, with which the
Alaseia carcase was clothed being the very counterpart
of that upon the Lena elephant; though <i>&agrave; priori</i> we
should have looked for a very different condition in the
integument of these huge Pachyderms.</p>

<p>If we look now at the great Mastodon, that elephantine
beast, which with a stature equal to that of the
tallest African elephant combined a much greater length
of body and bulk of limb, we shall see some reason for
concluding that the period of its decease is not indefinitely
removed from our own era. Its remains occur in
greatest abundance in North America; and it is interesting
to observe that among several of the aboriginal tribes
of Red men there were extant traditions of the Mastodon
as a living creature. Dim, vague, and distorted these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
traditions are; but so far from our rejecting them <i>in toto</i>
on that account, we ought rather to consider these characters
as evidence of their antiquity. When semi-savage
nations present us with orally-preserved accounts of very
remote objects or actions, we look, as a matter of course,
for a considerable element of the wild, and extravagant,
and absurd in them. If we found nothing but what was
reasonable, and consistent, and intelligible, we should say
in a moment, this account cannot have been transmitted
very far. The question, in the case before us, is not, we
must remember, the precise habits and instincts of the
Mastodon, but whether the Indians knew anything at all
of the Mastodon having ever been a living animal. Now,
as I have observed, they had. M. Fabri, a French officer
who had served in Canada, informed Buffon that the Red
men spoke of the great bones which lay scattered in
various parts of that region as having belonged to an
animal which, after their oriental style, they named <i>Le
P&egrave;re aux B&oelig;ufs</i>. The Shawnee Indians believed that
with these enormous animals there existed men of proportionate
development, and that the Great Being destroyed
both with thunderbolts. Those of Virginia stated that, as
a troop of these terrible quadrupeds were destroying the
deer, the bisons, and the other animals created for the use
of the Indians, the Great Man slew them all with His
thunder, except the big bull, who, nothing daunted, presented
his enormous forehead to the bolts, and shook them
off as they fell, till, being at last wounded in the side, he
fled towards the great lakes, where he is to this day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidence of the comparatively-recent entombment of
these remains exists, however, of another character. They
do not in general appear to have been rolled, but to have
lived where they are now found; in some instances, as
along the Great Osage River, being imbedded in a vertical
position, as if the animals had been suddenly bogged in
the swampy soil. Nor is there any great accumulation of
earth upon them generally. All along the edges of that
great saline morass called, from the abundance of these
animal relics, Big Bone Lick, and on the borders, the
skeletons are found sunk in the soft earth, many of them
not more than a yard or two below the surface, and some
even scarcely covered. With them are found in large
numbers the bones of the existing bison, the wapiti-stag,
and other herbivores, which still throng to the same place,
for the same reasons, and meet the same fate.</p>

<p>Comparative anatomy determines, from the structure
of the bones of the head in the Mastodon, that it must
have carried a proboscis like that of the elephant. This,
though wholly fleshy, has left traces of its existence.
Barton reports that, in 1762, out of five skeletons which
were seen by the natives, one skull still possessed what
they described as a "long nose" with the mouth under it.
And Kalm, in speaking of a skeleton, discovered by the
Indians in what is now the State of Illinois, says that the
form of the trunk was still apparent, though half decomposed.
The preservation of these perishable tissues in
this case must doubtless be attributed to the salt with
which the bog-earth is saturated. Still more recently a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
skeleton was found in Virginia, which contained a very
interesting proof of the food of the animal: a mass of
twigs, grass, and leaves, in a half-bruised state, enclosed
in a sort of sac, lay within the cavity of the body, doubtless
the contents of the stomach. Some of the twigs
could be identified as those of existing species of trees and
shrubs, among them a species of <i>rose</i>, still common in the
region.</p>

<p>All this is very strong evidence that the deposition of
these remains cannot have taken place in a <i>very</i> remote
era,&mdash;that, in fact, it must have been since the general
deluge recorded in the Word of God.</p>

<p>Hugh Miller has an interesting observation concerning
the actual date of geologic phenomena in North America,
compared with that of their counterparts in the Old World.
He says, "The much greater remoteness of the mastodontic
period in Europe than in America is a circumstance
worthy of notice, as it is one of many facts that seem to
indicate a general transposition of at least the later geologic
ages on the opposite sides of the Atlantic. Groups
of corresponding character on the eastern and western
shores of this great ocean were not contemporaneous in
time. It has been repeatedly remarked that the existing
plants and trees of the United States, with not a few of
its fishes and reptiles, bear in their forms and constructions
the marks of a much greater antiquity than those of
Europe. The geologist who set himself to discover similar
types on the eastern side of the Atlantic, would have to
seek for them among the deposits of the later tertiaries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
North America seems to be still passing through its later
tertiary ages; and it appears to be a consequence of this
curious transposition, that while in Europe the mastodontic
period is removed by two great geologic eras, from the
present time, it is removed from it in America by only
one."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Professor Agassiz has expressed opinions of the same
character, adducing the present existence in America of
several forms of animals, which are known in this hemisphere
only in a fossil state.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>I cannot refrain from adding the following combination
of fact and speculation, from the pen of an accomplished
traveller in Mexico. It opens up a new train of ideas:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some time before our visit, a number of workmen
were employed on the neighbouring estate of Chapingo,
to excavate a canal over that part of the plain from which
the waters have gradually retired during the last three
centuries. At four feet below the surface, they reached
an ancient causeway, of the existence of which there was
of course not the most remote suspicion. The cedar piles,
by which the sides were supported, were still sound at
heart. Three feet below the edge of this ancient work, in
what may have been the very ditch, they struck upon the
entire skeleton of a Mastodon, embedded in the blue clay.
Many of the most valuable bones were lost by the careless
manner in which they were extricated; others were ground
to powder on their conveyance to the capital, but sufficient
remained to prove that the animal had been of great size.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
My informant measured the diameter [<i>qu.</i> circumference?]
of the tusk, and found it to be eighteen inches.</p>

<p>"Though I should be very glad to take shelter under
the convenient <i>Quien sabe</i>? the use of which I have
suggested to you, I could not avoid, at the time I was in
Mexico, putting my isolated facts together, and feeling
inclined to believe that this country had not only been
inhabited in extremely remote times, when the valley bore
a very different aspect from that which it now exhibits, or
which tradition gives it, but that the extinct race of
enormous animals, whose remains would seem, in the
instance I have cited, to be coeval with the undated works
of man, may have been subjected to his will, and made
instrumental, by the application of their gigantic force,
to the transport of those vast masses of sculptured and
chiselled rock which we marvel to see lying in positions
so far removed from their natural site.</p>

<p>"The existence of these ancient paved causeways also,
not only from their solid construction over the flat and
low plains of the valley, but as they may be traced running
for miles over the dry table-land and the mountains,
appears to me to lend plausibility to the supposition;
as one might inquire, to what end the labour of such
works, in a country where beasts of burden were unknown?</p>

<p>"But I leave this subject to wiser heads and bolder
theorists. Had the Mammoth of Chapingo been discovered
with a ring in his nose, or a bit in his mouth, a
yoke on his head, or a crupper under his tail, the ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>tion
would have been set at rest. As it is, there is plenty
of room for conjecture and dispute."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>With respect to the great extinct Mammalia of South
America, we find Mr Darwin, to whom we are indebted
for our knowledge of so many of them, continually expressing
his wonder at the comparatively modern era of
their existence. After having enumerated nine vast
beasts, which he found imbedded in the beach at Bahia
Blanca, within the space of 200 yards square, and remarked
how numerous in kinds the ancient inhabitants of the
country must have been, he observes that "this enumeration
belongs to a very late tertiary period. From the
bones of the <i>Scelidotherium</i>, including even the kneecap,
being entombed in their proper relative positions,
and from the osseous armour of the great armadillo-like
animal being so well preserved, together with the bones
of one of its legs, we may feel assured that these remains
were fresh and united by their ligaments when deposited
in the gravel with the shells. Hence we have good evidence
that the above-enumerated gigantic quadrupeds,
more different from those of the present day than the oldest
of the tertiary quadrupeds of Europe, lived whilst the sea
was peopled with most of its present inhabitants."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Of the remains of the Mylodon, and of that strange
semi-aquatic creature the Toxodon, he says, they appeared
so fresh that it was difficult to believe they had
lain buried for ages under ground. The bones were so
fresh, that they yielded, on careful analysis, seven per
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>cent. of animal matter, and when heated in the flame of a
spirit-lamp, they not only exhaled a very strong animal
odour, but actually burned with a small flame.</p>

<p>Mr Darwin's interest was excited by the evidences
everywhere present of the immensity of this extinct population.
"The number of the remains imbedded in the
great estuary-deposit which forms the Pampas, and covers
the gigantic rocks of Banda Oriental, must be extraordinarily
great. I believe a straight line drawn in any
direction through the Pampas would cut through some
skeleton or bones.... We may suppose that the whole
area of the Pampas is one wide sepulchre of these extinct
gigantic quadrupeds."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The whole plain of South America from the Rio Plata
to the Straits of Magellan has been raised from the sea
within the species-life of the existing sea-shells, the old
and weathered specimens of which, left on the surface of
the plain, still partially retain their colours! Darwin
infers, as certain, from data which he has adduced, that
the Macrauchen, that strange giraffe-necked pachyderm,
lived <i>long after</i> the sea was inhabited by its present
shells, and when the vegetation of the land could not
have been other than it is now. And if the Macrauchen,
then the Toxodon, the Scelidothere, the Megathere, the
Mylodon, the Glyptodon, the Glossothere, and all the rest
of the quaint but mighty host of gone giants, that once
thronged these austral plains.</p>

<p>Evidence for the recent existence of the colossal ostrich-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>like
birds of New Zealand is stronger still. It is about
twenty-one years since the first intimation was given to
scientific Europe of the remains of such animals, through
some bones sent by the Rev. W. Williams to Dr Buckland.
From these, and a collection soon afterwards sent
home, Professor Owen established the genus <i>Dinornis</i>,
identifying five species, the largest of which, <i>D. giganteus</i>,
he concluded to have stood about ten feet in height. The
remains have since been obtained in great profusion, and
the result of further investigations by the Professor has
been the establishment of three other genera, viz., <i>Palapteryx</i>,
<i>Nestor</i>, and <i>Notornis</i>,&mdash;the latter a large bird
allied to the Rails and Coots.</p>

<p>A very interesting communication from Mr Williams
accompanied one of the consignments, extracts of which
I will quote. It bears date "Poverty Bay, New Zealand,
17th May 1842." "It is about three years ago, on paying
a visit to this coast, south of the East Cape, that the
natives told me of some extraordinary monster, which
they said was in existence in an inaccessible cavern on the
side of a hill near the river Wairoa; and they shewed me
at the same time some fragments of bone taken out of
the beds of rivers, which they said belonged to this creature,
to which they gave the name of <i>Moa</i>. When I
came to reside in this neighbourhood I heard the same
story a little enlarged; for it was said that this creature
<i>was still existing</i> at the said hill, of which the name is
Wakapunake, and that it is guarded by a reptile of the
Lizard species, but I could not learn that any of the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>sent
generation had seen it. I still considered the whole
as an idle fable, but offered a large reward to any who
would catch me either the bird or its protector." These
offers procured the collection of a considerable number of
fossil bones, on which Mr Williams makes the following
observations:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. None of these bones have been found on the dry
land, but are all of them from the banks and beds of
fresh-water rivers, buried only a little distance in the
mud.... All the streams are in immediate connexion
with hills of some altitude.</p>

<p>"2. This bird was in existence here at no very distant
time, though not in the memory of any of the inhabitants:
for the bones are found in the beds of the present streams,
and do not appear to have been brought into their present
situation by the action of any violent rush of waters.</p>

<p>"3. They existed in considerable numbers,&mdash;(an observation
which has since been abundantly confirmed.)</p>

<p>"4. It may be inferred that this bird was long-lived,
and that it was many years before it attained its full size.
(The writer grounds this inference on the disparity in
dimensions of the corresponding bones, supposing that
they all belonged to one and the same species; which,
however, was an erroneous assumption.)</p>

<p>"5. The greatest height of the bird was probably not
less than fourteen or sixteen feet. The leg-bones now
sent give the height of six feet to the root of the tail.</p>

<p>"Within the last few days I have obtained a piece of
information worthy of notice. Happening to speak to an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
American about these bones, he told me that the bird is
still in existence in the neighbourhood of Cloudy Bay, in
Cook's Straits. He said that the natives there had mentioned
to an Englishman belonging to a whaling party,
that there was a bird of extraordinary size to be seen
only at night, on the side of a hill near the place, and
that he, with a native and a second Englishman, went to
the spot; that, after waiting some time, they saw the
creature at a little distance, which they describe as being
about fourteen or sixteen feet high. One of the men
proposed to go nearer and shoot, but his companion was
so exceedingly terrified, or perhaps both of them, that
they were satisfied with looking at the bird, when, after a
little time, it took the alarm, and strode off up the side
of the mountain.</p>

<p>"This incident might not have been worth mentioning,
had it not been for the extraordinary agreement in point
of the size of the bird [with my deductions from the
bones]. <i>Here</i> are the bones which will satisfy you that
such a bird <i>has been</i> in existence; and <i>there</i> is said to be
the <i>living bird</i>, the supposed size of which, given by an
independent witness, precisely agrees."</p>

<div><a name="Fig.2" id="Fig.2">&nbsp;</a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<a href="images/fig051a-400dpi1200.jpg"><img src="images/fig051a-400dpi400.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="ENCOUNTER WITH A MOA." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">ENCOUNTER WITH A MOA.</span>
</div>

<p>The story told of the whaler appears to me to bear
marks of truth. The bold essay to explore, the terror
inspired by the gigantic figure, especially in the solemnity
of night, the description of the manners of the bird running
and striding, so like those of the Apteryx, with which
its bones shew the Moa to have been closely allied, and the
inglorious return of the party without achieving any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>exploit, are all too natural to permit the thought that no
more than inventive power has been at work.</p>

<p>And well may the colossus have inspired fear. The
bones sent to London greatly exceed in bulk those of the
largest horse. The leg-bone of a tall man is about one
foot four inches in length, and the thigh of O'Brien, the
Irish giant, whose skeleton, eight feet high, is mounted in
the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, is not quite
two feet. But the leg-bone (<i>tibia</i>) of the <i>Dinornis</i> we
know measured as much as two feet ten inches, and we
have no reason to suppose, considering the disparity that
exists in the specimens examined, that we have seen by
any means the largest.</p>

<p>Additional reason for supposing these magnificent birds
to have existed not long ago, is found in the fact that
specimens of their eggs have been preserved. The circumstances
attendant on the discovery and identification
of these possess a remarkable interest. In the volcanic
sand of New Zealand Mr Walter Mantell found a gigantic
egg, which we may reasonably infer to be that of either
<i>Dinornis</i> or <i>Palapteryx</i>, of the magnitude of which he
gives us a familiar idea by saying that his hat would have
been but just large enough to have served as an egg-cup
for it. This is the statement of a man of science, and
therefore we may assume an approximate degree of precision
in the comparison.</p>

<p>I do not know the size of Mr Mantell's hat, but I find
that the transverse diameter of my own is six inches or a
little more. If we may take this as the shorter diameter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the ovoid, the longer would probably be about eight
and a half inches; dimensions considerably greater than
those of the Ostrich's egg (which are about six and a
quarter in length), but not what we should have expected
from a bird from twelve to fourteen feet in height. And
this the rather when we consider that the egg of the
New Zealand <i>Apteryx</i>, to which these birds manifest a
very close affinity, is one of dimensions that are quite
surprising in proportion to the bulk of the bird. The
Apteryx is about as big as a turkey, standing two feet in
height, but its egg measures four inches ten lines by
three inches two lines in the respective diameters. The
egg of the <i>Dinornis giganteus</i>, to bear the same ratio to
the bird as this, would be of the incredible length of two
feet and a half, by a breadth of one and three quarters!
Possibly this specimen, though indubitably the egg of one
of this great family of extinct birds, may after all be that
of one of the subordinate species.</p>

<p>But about the same time as Mr Mantell's discovery, one
of equal interest was made in Madagascar. The master
of a French ship obtained, in 1850, from natives of the
island, three eggs, of far greater size, and fragments of
the leg-bones of an immense bird. These, on their arrival
at Paris, formed the subjects of valuable investigations by
M. Isidore Geoffroy St Hilaire<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and Professor Owen.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The native statement was, that one of the eggs had
been found entire in the bed of a torrent, among the
debris of a land-slip; that a second egg, with some frag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>ments
of bone, was subsequently found in a formation
<i>which is stated to be alluvial</i>; a third egg, which the
natives had perforated at one end, and used as a vessel,
was also found. This last egg was broken in the carriage,
the other two arrived in Europe entire.</p>

<p>These two, though nearly alike in size, differed considerably
in their relative proportions and shape, the one
being shorter and thicker, with more equal ends than the
other. The following table shews the dimensions of both
compared with those of an ostrich's egg:&mdash;</p>

<p>M. Geoffroy St Hilaire estimates the larger of the two
to contain 10&#8539; quarts, or the contents of nearly six eggs
of the Ostrich, or sixteen of the Cassowary, or a hundred
and forty-eight of the Hen, or fifty thousand of the Humming
bird.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The fragments of bone indicated a bird of the same
natural affinities as the New Zealand colossi, and of
dimensions not widely remote from theirs. Professor
Owen thinks that it did not exceed in height or size
<i>Dinornis giganteus</i>, and that there is a probability that it
was slightly smaller. The Madagascar bird has been
named <i>&AElig;pyornis maximus</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>The fragments of the egg of the New Zealand bird
(still uncertain as to the species to which it is to be
referred) shew that the shell was absolutely thinner, and
therefore relatively <i>much</i> thinner than that of the Ostrich's
egg; the air-pores, too, have a different form, being linear,
instead of round, and the surface is smoother. In these
qualities, the New Zealand egg resembles that of the
<i>Apteryx</i>; in the thickness and roughness of the egg of
<i>&AElig;pyornis</i> there is more similarity to those of the Ostrich
and Cassowary. The colour of the Madagascar egg is a
dull greyish yellow; but it is possible that this may be
derived from the soil in which it has long been imbedded.
The fragments of the New Zealand egg are white, like the
eggs of the <i>Apteryx</i> and Ostrich: those of the Emu and
Cassowary are light green.</p>

<p>The willing fancy suggests the possibility that, in an
island of such immensity as Madagascar, possessing lofty
mountain-ranges, covered with the most magnificent
forests, where civilised man has only yet touched one or
two spots on the seaward borders, but where these slight
explorations have educed so many wondrous animals, so
many strange forms of vegetable life, the noble <i>&AElig;pyornis</i>
may yet be stalking with giant stride along the fern-fringed
hill-sides, or through the steaming thickets;
though in the more contracted area of New Zealand its
equally ponderous cousins, the <i>Dinornis</i> and the <i>Palapteryx</i>,
may have sunk beneath the persevering persecutions
of man.</p>

<p>Yet another item of evidence bearing on the recent if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
not present existence of these great fowls has recently
come to light:&mdash;the most interesting discovery that one of
the genera whose fossil remains had been found associated
with theirs is really extant in New Zealand. I refer to
the <i>Notornis</i>.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Zoological Society of London, held
on the 13th November 1850, Dr Mantell made the following
communication relative to this discovery:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was in the course of last year, on the occasion of my
son's second visit to the south of the middle island, that
he had the good fortune to secure the recent <i>Notornis</i>,
which I now submit, having previously placed it in the
hands of the eminent ornithologist Mr Gould, to figure
and describe. This bird was taken by some sealers who
were pursuing their avocations in Dusky Bay. Perceiving
the trail of a large and unknown bird on the snow, with
which the ground was then covered, they followed the
footprints till they obtained a sight of the <i>Notornis</i>, which
their dogs instantly pursued, and, after a long chase,
caught alive in the gully of a sound behind Resolution
Island. It ran with great speed, and on being captured
uttered loud screams, and fought and struggled violently.
It was kept alive three or four days on board the schooner,
and then killed, and the body roasted and eaten by the
crew, each partaking of the dainty, which was declared to
be delicious. The beak and legs were of a bright red
colour. My son secured the skin, together with very fine
specimens of the Kapapo or ground parrot (<i>Strigops</i>), a
pair of Huias (<i>Neomorpha</i>), and two species of Kiwikiwi,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
namely <i>Apteryx Australis</i>, and <i>A. Oweni</i>. The latter
very rare bird is now added to the collection of the British
Museum."</p>

<p>"Mr Walter Mantell states, that, according to the native
traditions, a large Rail was contemporary with the Moa,
and formed a principal article of food among their ancestors.
It was known to the North Islanders by the name
'Moho,' and to the South Islanders by that of 'Takahe;'
but the bird was considered by both natives and Europeans
to have been long since exterminated by the wild
cats and dogs; not an individual having been seen or
heard of since the arrival of the English colonists. On
comparing the head of the bird with the fossil cranium,
and mandibles, and the figures and descriptions in the
'Zoological Transactions' (Plate lvi.), my son was at once
convinced of their identity. It may not be irrelevant to
add, that in the course of Mr Walter Mantell's journey
from Banks's Peninsula along the coast to Otago, he
learned from the natives that they believed there still
existed in that country the only indigenous terrestrial
quadruped, except a species of rat, which there are any
reasonable grounds for concluding New Zealand ever possessed.
While encamping at Arowenua, in the district
of Timaru, the Maoris assured them that about ten miles
inland there was a quadruped which they called K&aacute;ureke,
and that it was formerly abundant, and often kept by
their ancestors in a domestic state as a pet animal. It
was described as about two feet in length, with coarse
grizzly hair; and must have more nearly resembled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
otter or badger than the beaver or the Ornithorhynchus,
which the first accounts seem to suggest as the probable
type. The offer of a liberal reward induced some of the
Maoris to start for the interior of the country where the
K&aacute;ureke was supposed to be located; but they returned
without having obtained the slightest trace of the existence
of such an animal. My son, however, expresses his
belief in the native accounts, and that, if the creature no
longer exists, its extermination is of very recent date.
In concluding this brief narrative of the discovery of a
genus of birds once contemporary with the colossal Moa,
and hitherto only known by its fossil remains, I beg to
remark that this highly interesting fact tends to confirm
the conclusions expressed in my communication to the
Geological Society, namely, that the <i>Dinornis</i>, <i>Palapteryx</i>,
and related forms, were coeval with some of the existing
species of birds peculiar to New Zealand, and that their
final extinction took place at no very distant period, and
long after the advent of the aboriginal Maoris."</p>

<p>Mr Gould then read a paper pointing out the zoological
characters of the bird discovered by Mr Mantell, which
he had no hesitation in identifying as the species formerly
characterised, from its osseous remains, by Professor
Owen, under the name of <i>Notornis Mantelli</i>. Mr Gould,
in adverting to the extreme interest with which the present
existence of a species which was certainly contemporary
with the Moa must be regarded, pointed out, from
the preserved skin, which was on the table, how accurate
a prevision of its character had been made by Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Owen, when investigating the fragments from which our
first knowledge of it had been derived.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>At length I come home to Great Britain and Ireland&mdash;the
"nice little, tight little islands" where so many of
our sympathies properly centre, where natural-history
facts and all other facts interest us so much more than
parallel facts elsewhere, and where, above all, there are so
many more lights streaming into the darkness, and bringing
out truth. Let us again look back to the period of
the Bison, and Reindeer, and Elk, of the Elephant, and Hippopotamus,
and Rhinoceros, of the Lion and the Hyena,
and the great Cave Bear, and search among the vanishing
traces of the far past for glimpses of evidence when their
age ceased to be.</p>

<p>Some dim light falls on the obscurity from the discovery
of the fossil remains of man himself&mdash;the human
bones found by Dr Schmerling in a cavern near Liege,
the remains mentioned by M. Marcel de Serres and others
in several caverns in France, associated with fossil relics
of this period. But more from the occurrence of flints,
apparently fashioned by human art, in superficial deposits,
together with the same extinct fossils of the tertiary.
Even at the very moment that I write this sheet, my eye
falls on the report<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of an important meeting of the
Ethnological Society, for the purpose of discussing this
very subject of "The flint implements found associated
with the bones of extinct animals in the Drift." Many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>of the leading geologists and arch&aelig;ologists were present,
for the matter has become one of absorbing interest, conflicting,
as the facts seem to do, with some assumptions
received as unquestioned verities in Geology.</p>

<p>These flints, which seem indubitably to have been
chipped into the forms of arrow-heads, lance-heads, and
the like, have been found in France in large numbers, as
also in other parts of the continent, and in England.
They resemble those still used by some savage tribes. In
this very neighbourhood, as in the cavern called Kent's
Hole near Torquay, and in one more recently examined at
Brixham, they are found mixed up with the bones of the
Rhinoceros, of the Cave Bear, and the Hyena, At Menchecourt,
near Abbeville, they occur in a deposit of sand,
sandy clay, and marl, with bones of the same animals, and
others, their contemporaries. Concerning this bed, Mr
Prestwich, in a paper read before the Royal Society, May
26, 1859, says that it must be referred to those usually designated
as post pliocene, but that the period of its deposit
was anterior to that of the surface assuming its present
outline, so far as some of its minor features are concerned.
"He does not, however, consider that the facts
of necessity carry man back in past time more than they
<i>bring forward the great extinct mammals towards our
own time</i>, the evidence having reference only to relative,
and not to absolute time; and he is of opinion that many
of the later geological changes may have been sudden, or
of shorter duration than generally considered. In fact,
from the evidence here exhibited, and from all that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
knows regarding the drift phenomena generally, the
author sees no reason against the conclusion that this
period of man and the extinct mammals&mdash;supposing their
contemporaneity to be proved&mdash;was brought to a sudden
end by a temporary inundation of the land; on the contrary,
he sees much to support such a view on purely
geological considerations."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>At the meeting of the Ethnological Society just held,
there seems to have been an increasing tendency to admit
the hypothesis of the continuance of the Mammalia of
the Tertiary into the human era. Mr Evans, who exhibited
specimens taken at a depth of twenty to thirty feet,
from a stratum of coarse fresh-water gravel, lying on chalk,
and containing an entire skeleton of an extinct Rhinoceros,
and overlaid by sandy marl containing existing shells,
shewed that the deposit had certainly not been disturbed
till the present time, so that the gravel, the bones, and the
flints had been deposited coetaneously. He suggested
"that the animals supposed to have become extinct
before man was created might have continued to exist
to more recent periods than had been admitted." And
this opinion found support from other leading geologists.</p>

<p>That this conclusion would throw the existence of man
to an era far higher than that assigned to him by the
inspired Word, is, I know, generally held; and certain
investigations, made in the alluvial deposit of the Nile,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
are considered to prove that man has been living in a
state of comparative civilisation in the Nile Valley for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>the last 13,500 years. But that conclusion absolutely
rests on the supposition that the rate of increase formed
by the annual deposit of the Nile mud has been always
exactly the same as now,&mdash;a supposition, not only without
the least shadow of proof, but also directly contrary to
the highest probability, nay, certainty, in the estimation
of those who believe in the Noachian deluge. For surely
the drainage of the entire plain of North Africa after
that inundation must have produced an alluvium of
vast thickness in a very brief time; while beneath that
deposit the works of the antediluvian world might well
be buried. Yet the possibility of there ever having been
any greater rate of deposit than within the last 3000
years, the recorder of those investigations, in his unseemly
haste to prove the Bible false, strangely leaves wholly out
of his consideration.</p>

<p>So, doubtless, concerning other deposits containing
fossil remains, whose extreme antiquity is assumed from
the known rate of surface-increase now, we ought to
remember that we have not a tittle of proof that the rate
of increase has not at certain remote periods been suddenly
and immensely augmented. There are many facts
on record which tend to shew that the rate at which
geologic changes take place in certain localities affords no
reliable data whatever to infer that at which phenomena
apparently quite parallel have occurred in other localities.
An upheaval or a subsidence of one part of a country
may rapidly effect a great change in the amount of soil or
gravel precipitated by streams, without destroying or
changing their channels, and yet the deposit may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
made sufficiently gradually to allow the burial of shells
or of bones of creatures which lived and died on the spot.</p>

<p>The degradation of a cliff, either suddenly or gradually,
might throw a vast quantity of fragments into a rapid
stream, and cause a deposit of gravel of considerable
breadth and thickness in a comparatively short period
of time,&mdash;say a century or two.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Lyell has adduced examples of very rapid
formation of certain stony deposits, which should make
us cautious how we assert that such and such a thickness
<i>must</i> have required a vast number of years. In one of
them there is a thickness of 200 or 300 feet of travertine of
recent deposit, while in another, a solid mass <i>thirty feet thick
was deposited in about twenty years</i>. There are countless
places in Italy where the formation of limestone may be
seen, as also in Auvergne and other volcanic districts.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>From these and similar considerations it seems to me
by no means unreasonable that the four thousand years
which elapsed between the Creation and the commencement
of Western European history should have been
amply sufficient for many of those geological operations
whose results are seen in what are known as the later
Tertiary deposits,&mdash;the crag, the drift, the cavern-accumu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>lations,
and the like. And, as a corollary to this, that
the great extinct Mammalia may have extended into this
period, and thus have been contemporary with man, for
a greater or less duration, according to the species; some,
probably, having been extinguished at a very early period
of the era, while others lived on to the time I have named,
or even later.</p>

<p>But have we nothing better for this conclusion than an
assumption of the possibility, and a more or less probable
conjecture? Yes; we have some facts of interest to warrant
it, or I should not have ventured to introduce the
subject in this work. There are facts,&mdash;besides the admixture
of human workmanship with the animal remains in
undisturbed deposits&mdash;direct evidence, not altogether
shadowy, of the co-existence of the extinct animals with
living men.</p>

<p>And first, I would mention some circumstances bearing
analogy to the exhumation of the fresh Pachyderms of
Siberia. Some years ago, a portion of the leg of an Irish
Elk, so-called, (<i>Megaceros hibernicus</i>,) with a part of the
tendons, skin, and hair upon it, was dug up with other
remains from a deposit on the estate of H. Grogan Morgan,
Esq., of Johnstown Castle, Wexford, and is now in
that gentleman's possession. This leg was exhibited, and
formed the subject of a lecture at the time by Mr Peile,
veterinary surgeon, Dublin.</p>

<p>It has been ascertained that the marrow in some of the
bones blazes like a candle; that the cartilage and gelatine,
so far from having been destroyed, were not appar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>ently
altered by time.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Archdeacon Maunsell actually
made soup of the bones, and presented a portion thereof
to the Royal Dublin Society (whether they enjoyed it I
have not heard; it must have been "a little high," I
fear). They are frequently used by the peasantry for
fuel. On the occasion of the rejoicings for the victory at
Waterloo, a bonfire was made of these bones, and it was
observed that they gave out as good a blaze as those of
horses, often used for similar purposes.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Pepper, in his "History of Ireland," states that the
ancient Irish used to hunt a very large black deer, the
milk of which they used as we do that of the cow, and
the flesh of which served them for food, and the skin for
clothing. This is a very remarkable record; and is
confirmed by some bronze tablets found by Sir William
Betham, the inscriptions on which attested that the
ancient Irish fed upon the milk and flesh of a great black
deer.</p>

<p>According to the "Annals of the Four Masters," Niel
Sedamin, a king of Ireland before the Christian era, was
so called because "the cows and the female deer were alike
milked in his reign." The art of taming the wild deer
and converting them into domestic cattle is said to have
been introduced by Flidisia, this monarch's mother. Deer
are said to have been used to carry stones and wood for
Codocus when his monastery was built, as also to carry
timber to build the castle of a king of Connaught. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
may have been red deer, but as there is good proof that
the giant deer was really domesticated, it seems more
likely that such offices should have been performed by the
latter than by the former.</p>

<p>An interesting letter from the Countess of Moira, published
in the "Arch&aelig;ologia Britannica," gives an account
of a human body found in gravel under eleven feet of
peat, soaked in the bog-water; it was in good preservation,
and completely clothed in antique garments of deer-hair,
conjectured to be that of the Giant Elk.</p>

<p>A skull of the same animal has been discovered in
Germany in an ancient drain, together with several urns
and stone-hatchets. And in the museum of the Royal
Dublin Society there exists a fossil rib bearing evident
token of having been wounded by some sharp instrument
which remained long infixed in the wound, but had not
penetrated so deep as to destroy the creature's life. It
was such a wound as the head of an arrow, whether of
flint or of metal, would produce.</p>

<p>In the year 1846, a very interesting corroboration of
the opinion long held by some that the great broad-horned
Deer was domesticated by the ancient Irish, was given by
the discovery of a vast collection of bones at Lough G&ucirc;r,
near Limerick. The word G&ucirc;r is said to mean "an assemblage,"
so that the locality is "the Lake of the Assemblage,"
commemorating perhaps the gathering of an army
or some other host at the spot. In the midst of the lake
is an island, which is described as being so completely
surrounded with bones and skulls of animals "that one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
would think the cattle of an entire nation must have been
slaughtered to procure so vast an assemblage."</p>

<p>The skulls are described as belonging to the following
animals:&mdash;The giant deer (females); a deer of inferior
size; the stag; another species of stag; the fallow deer;
the broad-faced ox; the hollow-faced ox; the long-faced
ox; another species of ox; the common short-horned ox;
the goat; and the hog.</p>

<p>The principal points of interest centred in the Giant
Deer or so-called Irish Elk. The skulls of these, as of all
the larger animals, "were broken in by some sharp and
heavy instrument, and in the same manner as butchers of
the present day slaughter cattle for our markets, and in
many cases the marrow-bones were broken across, as if to
get at the marrow."</p>

<p>Of course, if this was indubitable, the conclusion was
inevitable, that the Giant Deer was not only contemporary
with man, but was domesticated by him with other
quadrupeds, and used for food. Professor Owen, however,
contended that the skulls of the Giant Deer were not
females but males, from which the horns had been forcibly
removed, and that the holes in the foreheads were made by
the violent wrenching off of the horns tearing away a
portion of the frontal bone from which they grew.</p>

<p>In reply to this opinion, Mr H. D. Richardson of
Dublin, whose personal acquaintance with the relics of
this noble species is peculiarly extensive, shewed that
certain variations of proportion on which the learned
Professor relied to prove the skulls to be male, were of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
no such value, individual animals presenting great discrepancies
in these respects: that the total absence of
cornuous peduncles from the sides of the forehead, and of
the elevated bony ridge, conclusively proved the sex to be
female, which was permanently destitute of horns; and
that in no case could it be said that the ridge was forced
away, since the violence was confined to a <i>small hole</i> in
the centre of the forehead.</p>

<p>To put the matter to test, Mr Richardson experimented
on two perfect male skulls. In the one instance the force
was applied to the beam of the horns, and the result was
their fracture where they are united to the peduncles.
In the other case the force was applied to the peduncles
themselves, to ascertain whether it was possible to wrench
them and the ridge away from the face, when the consequence
was, that the skull was completely riven asunder.
Indeed to any one who looks at the position of the horns
in this animal, and their implantation, it must be self-evident
that their violent removal must tear away the
entire forehead, and not leave a central hole. Mr Edward
Newman who subsequently examined the specimens speaks
decidedly on this point:&mdash;"I have not the least hesitation
in expressing my firm conviction that the fractures were
the result of human hands, and were the cause of the
death of the animals. These two fractured skulls correspond
too exactly with each other, and with that of a
bullock with which I compared them, to have resulted
from accident: the edges of the fractures wore the
appearance of having been coeval with the interment or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
submergence of the skulls, and presented a very strikingly
different appearance from a fracture recently made, and
which I had the opportunity of examining. There were
several skulls of the male of the same species, one bearing
enormous antlers, but none exhibiting the slightest trace
of frontal fracture."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>A circumstance of much importance is that these skulls
were found in company with those of many well-known
domestic animals, as the ox, the goat, and the hog. <i>These
skulls were similarly fractured.</i> As it is evident that
<i>their</i> demolition was produced by the butcher's pole-axe,
why not that of the elk-skulls?</p>

<p>"At the first cursory glance, it may appear somewhat
strange that the skulls of the males should invariably have
been found entire, and that even the recent discovery at
Lough G&ucirc;r should form no exception.</p>

<p>"I do not, however, find any difficulty here. In the first
place, we may fairly suppose that males, like our bulls, were
not equally prized as food. In the second place, the size,
as well as the position of the antlers, would render it next
to an impossibility to give the desired blow with the pole-axe.
In the third place, the greater strength and thickness
of the skull would almost to a certainty render the
blow unavailing; and in the fourth place, supposing the
females domesticated, and the occasional tenants of sheds
and other buildings, we may well imagine that the males
were excluded from such buildings by the enormous size
of their antlers. Perhaps a few only of the males, as in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
our cattle, were suffered to become adult, one male sufficing
for many females. Perhaps the males were allowed
free range, the females only being permitted at stated
seasons to accompany them. In fine, the more we investigate
probabilities, the more we reason from present
experience and knowledge, the less difficulty shall we
find in the way of believing the gigantic deer of Ireland
an animal coeval with man and subservient to his
uses."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In a communication subsequently made to the <i>Zoologist</i>
by Mr Richardson, he gives the following additional evidence:&mdash;"In
the collection of the late Mr Johnston, of
Down, which had been left by his uncle, an attorney, and
in which everything was labelled with the accuracy and
precision of that profession, is a small brass spear, with a
piece of wood still in the socket, with a label, stating it to
have been found in a marl-pit, among the bones of a deer.
An excise-officer told me that he saw, found in a marl-pit,
at Mentrim in Meath, the skeleton of a deer, and a man,
and a long knife: the latter, I believe, is rather a short
sword, now, I think, in the collection of Mr Petrie, of
Dublin, who told me that some such tradition had accompanied
it into his possession.... Dr Martin informs me
that on the banks of the river Suir, near Portland, Waterford,
and on nearly every farm, are found, near springs,
spaces of frequently seventy feet in diameter, consisting
of stones, broken up as if for roads, and lying together in
a mass. These stones were evidently purposely broken,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and all much of one size, and are charred. These spaces
are many feet in depth. The tradition respecting them
is current among the peasantry, that here in olden time,
a great deer was killed and baked in these stone-pits, the
stones having been previously heated like a kiln, and they
also distinguish the animal as the 'Irish Elk.' These
places are called in Irish by a name signifying the 'Buck's
Den.'"</p>

<span class="caption">SPEARING THE ANCIENT ELK.</span>
</div>

<p>From all these testimonies combined, can we hesitate a
moment in believing that the Giant Deer was an inhabitant
of Ireland since its colonisation by man? It seems to me
that its extinction cannot have taken place more than a
thousand years ago. Perhaps at the very time that C&aelig;sar
invaded Britain the Celts in the sister isle were milking
and slaughtering their female elks, domesticated in their
cattlepens of granite, and hunting the proud-antlered
male with their flint arrows and lances. It would appear,
that the mode of hunting him was to chase and terrify
him into pools and swamps, such as the marl-pits then
were; that, having thus disabled him in the yielding bogs,
and slain him, the head was cut off, as of too little value
to be worth the trouble of dragging home; that the under
jaws and tongue were cut off; and that frequently the
entire carcase was disjointed on the spot, the best parts
only being removed. This would account for the so frequent
occurrence of separate portions of the skeleton, and
especially of skulls, in the bog-earth. No doubt so large
an animal would not long survive in a state of freedom,
after an island so limited in extent as Ireland became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>peopled throughout; and supposing the females to have
been domesticated, it is quite conceivable that the difficulty
or even danger of capturing or domesticating the
males, may have caused the species soon to become extinct
in captivity, when it no longer continued to exist in a
wild state. Thus we may perhaps account for the
certainly remarkable fact that no native Irish name has
been recognised as belonging to it;&mdash;remarkable, because
the Irish tongue is particularly rich in distinctive names
for natural objects. There exists a very curious ancient
poem in that language which professes to enumerate the
whole fauna of the island. It is founded on the legend
that Fian MacCumhaill was made prisoner by Cormac
MacArt, king of Erinn; that the victor promised to give
him freedom on condition that, as a ransom, a pair of each
wild animal found in Ireland were brought before him on
the green of Tara. Cailte MacRonain, the foster-brother
of the captive general undertook the task, and succeeded
in bringing the collection before the king within a twelvemonth;
and in the poem, he is supposed to narrate to St
Patrick the detail and result of his enterprise. Of this
poem, which is considered to be as early as the ninth
century, the reader may like to see the following translation
by Mr Eugene Curry, containing the zoological

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p><p>No <i>known</i> allusion occurs in this poem to the Giant
Deer.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> First, however, we must remember that no small
number of the animals mentioned are quite unrecognisable;
and that of those names to which an explanation is
given, many are probably incorrectly rendered. Secondly,
if it could be absolutely shewn that no allusion exists to
that fine beast, it would not at all disprove its existence
a thousand years before. Supposing that the <i>Megaceros</i>
became extinct soon after the colonisation of Ireland, and
that this was several centuries before the Christian era,
the distinctive name by which it had been known might
well have died out and become extinct also, among a
people unacquainted with letters. Or if a dim tradition
of the animal and of its name still lingered here and there,
it might well be omitted from a catalogue which professed
to give the creatures actually collected in a living state at
a given period. It would have been interesting to have
been able to identify the Great Elk, but its introduction
would have been a glaring anachronism.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>The enumeration of nearly a hundred and sixty quadrupeds
and birds either indigenous to or naturalised in
Ireland at so early a period, possesses, I say, a peculiar
interest.</p>

<p>If the editor's suggestion is correct, that the <i>Echtach</i>
was a bovine animal, then we have three distinct mentions
of this family in the poem,&mdash;the Wild Oxen, the
Echtachs, and the Bull and White Cow. The second and
third of these were probably domesticated animals; the
first one expressly "Wild." Now at least five distinct
species of Oxen are known to have inhabited Europe and
the British Isles during the later periods of the Tertiary
era, which have been named respectively, <i>Bison priscus</i>,
<i>Bos primigenius</i>, <i>frontosus</i> and <i>longifrons</i>, and <i>Ovibos
moschatus</i>. Of these, skulls of <i>Bos frontosus</i> and <i>B.
longifrons</i> have been dug up in some numbers in Ireland.
Some of these bear, in the perforation of the forehead,
evident proof of having been slaughtered <i>secundum artem</i>,
and therefore of having been domesticated. But one large
skull of the <i>longifrons</i> type, now in the Museum of the
Royal Irish Academy, has a cut in the forehead, into which
can be accurately fitted several of the narrow bronze
"celts," or arrow-heads so frequently dug up in Ireland;
a pretty fair proof that this animal was killed by the
hunter's arrow, and was therefore wild.</p>

<p>No bovine animals of the true taurine race are now
known to exist in an aboriginally wild state; but at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
epoch of our earliest historical knowledge of central and
western Europe it was far otherwise. C&aelig;sar, describing,
under the name of <i>Urus</i>, certain wild oxen of the great
Hercynian forest, says, "These Uri are little inferior to
elephants in size, but are bulls in their nature, colour,
and figure. Great is their strength, and great their
swiftness, nor do they spare man or beast when once they
have caught sight of him. These, when trapped in pitfalls,
the hunters unsparingly kill. The youths, exercising
themselves by this sort of hunting, are hardened by the
toil, and those among them who have killed most, bringing
with them the horns, as testimonials, acquire great
praise. But these Uri cannot be habituated to man, nor
made tractable, not even when taken young. The great
size of the horns, as well as the form and quality of them,
differs much from those of our oxen."</p>

<p>It is probable that this race extended widely over
Europe, and even into Asia. Herodotus mentions Macedonian
wild oxen, with exceedingly large (<span title="Greek: hypermegathia">&#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#953;&#945;</span>)
horns; and Philip of Macedon killed a wild bull in Mount
Orbela, which had made great havoc, and produced much
terror among the inhabitants; its spoils he hung up in the
Temple of Hercules. The Assyrian artists delighted to
sculpture on the royal bas-reliefs of Nineveh the conquest
of the wild bull by the prowess of their Nimrod monarchs,
and the figures, in their minute anatomical characters,
well agree with the descriptions and remains of the European
<i>Urus</i>. The large forest that surrounded ancient
London was infested with <i>boves sylvestres</i> among other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
wild beasts, and it is probable that these were <i>Uri</i>. The
legendary exploit of Guy, Earl of Warwick, in freeing the
neighbourhood from a terrible dun cow, whether historically
true or not, shews the existence of formidable wild
bovines in the heart of England, and the terror they
inspired among the people. The family of Turnbull, in
Scotland, are traditionally said to owe their patronymic to
a hero who turned a wild bull from Robert the Bruce,
when it had attacked him while hunting.</p>

<p>What has become of the terrible Uri which lived in
Europe at the commencement of the Christian era? Advancing
civilisation has rooted them out, so that no living
trace of them remains, unless the cream-white breed which
is preserved in a semi-wild state in some of our northern
parks be their representatives; or, as is not improbable,
their blood may still circulate in our domestic oxen.</p>

<p>Yet there is no doubt of the identity of a species found
abundantly in Britain in the Tertiary deposits, and named
by Owen <i>Bos primigenius</i>, with the Urus of C&aelig;sar. This
fossil bull was as certainly contemporary in this island
with the elephant, and the hyena, and the baboon, and,
strange to say, with the reindeer, and the musk-ox, too&mdash;thus
combining a tropical, a temperate, and an arctic
fauna in our limited island at the same period! What a
strange climate it must have been to suit them all!</p>

<p>Professor Nilsson, who has paid great attention to fossil
oxen, mentions a skull of this species which must have
belonged to an animal more than twelve feet in length
from the nape to the root of the tail, and six feet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
a half in height. Again, the skull of a cow in the British
Museum, figured by Professor Owen, measures thirty
inches from the crown to the tips of the jaws! What a
beast must this have been! Would not the slaughter of
such a "Dun Cow" as this in single combat have been an
exploit worthy of a doughty earl?</p>

<p>That this ancient fossil bull was really contemporary
with man in Scandinavia is proved by evidence which is
irrespective of the question of its identity with C&aelig;sar's
Urus. For one of Professor Nilsson's specimens "bears
on its back a palpable mark of a wound from a javelin.
Several celebrated anatomists and physiologists, among
whom," he says, "I need only mention the names of John
M&uuml;ller, of Berlin, and Andreas Retzius, of Stockholm, have
inspected this skeleton, and are unanimous in the opinion
that the hole in question upon the backbone is the consequence
of a wound, which, during the life of the animal,
was made by the hand of man. The animal must have
been very young, probably only a calf, when it was
wounded. The huntsman who cast the javelin must have
stood before it. It was yet young when it died, probably
not more than three or four years old."</p>

<p>We may, then, assume as certain that the vast <i>Bos
primigenius</i> of Western Europe lived as a wild animal
contemporaneously with man; and as almost certain
(assuming its identity with the <i>Urus</i>) that it continued to
be abundant as late as the Christian era.</p>

<p>The <i>Bos frontosus</i> is a middling-sized bovine. "Its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
remains," says Professor Nilsson, "are found in turf-bogs
in Southern Scandinavia, and in such a state as plainly
shews that they belonged to a more ancient period than
that in which tame cattle existed in Sweden. This species
lived in Scandinavia contemporaneously with the <i>Bos
primigenius</i>, and the <i>Bison Europ&aelig;us</i>.... If ever it
was tamed, and thereby in the course of time contributed
to form some of the tame races of cattle, it must have
been the small-horned, often hornless, breed, which is to
be found in the mountains of Norway, and which has a
high protuberance between the setting-on of the horns
above the nape."</p>

<p>This species occurs in a fossil state in some numbers in
Ireland; it has also been found in England. It is by
some supposed to be the origin of, or, at least, to have
contributed blood to, the middling Highland races with
high occiput, and small horns.</p>

<p>There is more certainty of the co-existence of the small
<i>B. longifrons</i> with man. Some of the evidence I have
already adduced. "Within a few years," says a trustworthy
authority, "we have read in one of the scientific
periodicals,&mdash;but have just now sought in vain for the
notice,&mdash;of a quantity of bones that were dug up in some
part of England, together with other remains of what
seemed to be the relics of a grand feast, held probably
during the Roman domination of Britain, for, if we mistake
not, some Roman coins were found associated with them.
<i>There were skulls</i> and other remains of <i>Bos longifrons</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
quite undistinguishable in form from the antique fossil,
whether wild or domesticated, which, of course, remains a
question."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Professor Owen conjectures that this species may have
contributed to form the present small shaggy Highland
and Welsh cattle,&mdash;the kyloes and runts; and a similar
breed in the northern parts of Scania may have had a
similar origin.</p>

<p>In the <i>Bison priscus</i>, the fossil remains of which occur
in many parts of Europe, and more sparsely in Great
Britain,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> we have an example of a noble animal, which,
contemporary with all those which have been engaging
our attention, survives to the present hour, but is dying
out, and would have long ago been extinguished, probably,
but for the fostering influence of human conservation. For
the species is considered as absolutely identical with the
<i>Bison Europ&aelig;us</i> of modern zoology, the Bison or Wisent
of the Germans, the Aurochs of the Prussians, the Zubr
of the Poles, that formidable creature, which is maintained
by the Czar in an ever-diminishing herd in the vast forests
of Lithuania,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and which, perhaps, still lingers in the
fastnesses of the Caucasus. This, the largest, or at least
the most massive of all existing quadrupeds, after the
great Pachyderms, roamed over Germany in some numbers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>as late as the era of Charlemagne. Considerably later
than this it is reckoned among the German beasts of
chase, for in the <i>Niebelungen Lied</i>, a poem of the twelfth
century, it is said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">"Dar nach schlouch er schiere, einen wisent und einen elch,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Starcher ure viere, und einen grimmen schelch."</span><br /></div>
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">"After this he straightway slew a bison and an elk,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the strong uri four, and a single fierce schelch."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span><br />
</div></div>

<p>It is a formidable beast, standing six feet high at the
shoulders, where it is protected by a thick and profuse
mane. Specimens have been known to reach a ton in
weight. It manifests an invincible repugnance to the
ox.</p>

<p>There are several other animals of note which, like the
Bison, were once common inhabitants of these islands,
but have long been extinct here, though more genial
circumstances have preserved their existence on the continent
of Europe. Of the great Cave Bear, no evidence
of its period exists, that I know of, except that which
may be deduced from the commixture of its remains with
those of other animals of whose recent date we have proof.
But there is another kind of Bear, whose relics in a fossil
state are not uncommon in the Tertiary deposits, viz.,
the common Black Bear (<i>Ursus arctos</i>) of Europe.</p>

<p>This savage animal must have early succumbed to man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
The "Triads"<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> mention bears as living here before the
Kymri came. The Roman poets knew of their existence
here: Martial speaks of the robber Laureolus being
exposed on the cross to the fangs of the <i>Caledonian</i>
Bear; and Claudian alludes to British bears. The Emperor
Claudius, on his return to Rome after the conquest
of this island, exhibited, as trophies, combats of British
bears in the arena. In the Penitential of Archbishop
Egbert, said to have been compiled about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 750, bears
are mentioned as inhabiting the English forests, but they
must have gradually become rare, for the chase-laws of
Canute, at the beginning of the eleventh century, are
silent about them. In Doomsday Book, we find incidental
notice of this animal, for the city of Norwich is said to
have been required to furnish a bear annually to Edward
the Confessor, together with "six dogs for the bear,"&mdash;no
doubt for baiting him. This seems to have been the
latest trace on record of the bear in Britain; unless the
tradition may compete with it, which states that one of
the Gordon family was empowered by the king of Scotland
to carry three bears' heads on his banner, as a reward
for his prowess in slaying a fierce bear.</p>

<p>In Ireland it seems to have become extinct even yet
earlier. Bede says the only ravenous animals in his day
were the wolf and the fox; Donatus, who died in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 840,
distinctly says it was not a native of the island in his
time; and Geraldus Cambrensis does not enumerate it as
known in the twelfth century. Neither is it included in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the ransom-beasts of Cailte's collection. Yet a native
Irish name for the bear&mdash;Mathghambain&mdash;occurs in an
old glossary<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin;
and the late Wm. Thomson says that a tradition is current
of its having once been an Irish animal; and it is
associated with the wolf as a native beast in the stories
handed down from generation to generation to the present
time.</p>

<p>The wolf, however, survived in both islands to a much
later era. In the days of the Heptarchy it was a terrible
pest; King Edgar commuted the punishment of certain
offences into a requisition for a fixed number of wolves'
tongues; and he converted a heavy tax on one of the
Welsh princes into an annual tribute of three hundred
wolves' heads. These laws continued to the time of
Edward I., when the increasing scarcity of the animal
doubtless caused them to fall into disuse. Mr Topham,
in his Notes to Somerville's "Chase," says, that it was in
the wolds of Yorkshire that a price was last set on a
wolf's head. The last record of their occurring in formidable
numbers in England is in 1281; but for three
centuries after this, the mountains and forests of Scotland
harboured them; for Hollinshed reports that in
1577 the wolves were very troublesome to the flocks of
that country. Nor were they entirely destroyed out of
this island till about a century afterwards, when the last
wolf fell in Lochaber, by the hand of Sir Ewen Cameron
of Lochiel. In Ireland the last wolf was slain in 1710.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus here we are able to lay our finger on the exact dates
when a large and rapacious species of animal actually
became extinct so far as the British Isles are concerned.
And if the species had been confined in its geographical
limits, as many other species of animals are, to one group
of islands, we should know the precise date of its absolute
extinction.</p>

<p>The Beaver was once an inhabitant of British rivers.
Its remains are found in Berkshire, Cambridgeshire,
Yorkshire, and elsewhere, associated with the other Mammalia
of the fresh-water deposits and caves, but not in
any abundance. No record of its actual existence, however,
in these counties exists, nor anywhere else but in
Wales and Scotland, whose mountain streams and rugged
ravines afforded it shelter till after the Norman Conquest.
It was very rare even then, and for a hundred years before;
for the laws of Howel Dda, the Welsh king, who died in
948, in determining the value of peltry, fix the price
of the beaver's skin at a hundred and twenty pence, when
the skins of the stag, the wolf, the fox, and the otter, were
worth only eightpence each, that of the white weasel or
ermine at twelvepence, and that of the marten, at twenty-four
pence. The appropriate epithet of Broad-tail (Llostllyddan)
was given it by the Welsh. Giraldus Cambrensis,
who travelled through Wales in 1188, gives, in his Itinerary,
a short account of the beaver, but states that the river
Teivy in Cardiganshire, and one other river in Scotland,
were the only places in Great Britain, where it was then
found. In all probability it did not long survive that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
century, for no subsequent notice of it as a British animal
is extant. Tradition, however, still preserves the remembrance
of its presence in those indelible records, names of
places. "Two or three waters in the Principality," says
Pennant, "still bear the name of <i>Llyn yr afangc</i>,&mdash;the
Beaver Lake.... I have seen two of their supposed
haunts: one in the stream that runs through Nant Francon;
the other in the river Conwy, a few miles above
Llanrwst; and both places, in all probability, had formerly
been crossed by beaver-dams."</p>

<p>If, as naturalists of the highest eminence believe, there
is specific difference between the beaver of Europe and
that of America, then we may say that our species is fast
passing away from the earth. A few colonies yet linger
along the banks of the Danube, the Weser, the Rhone
and the Euphrates, but they consist of few individuals,
ever growing fewer; and the value of their fur exciting
cupidity, they cannot probably resist much longer the
exterminating violence of man.</p>

<p>The causes which led to the extinction of these animals
in our islands are then obvious, and are thus playfully
touched by the late James Wilson:&mdash;"The beaver might
have carried on business well enough, in his own quiet
way, although frequently incommoded by the love of
peltry on the part of a hat-wearing people; but it is clear
that no man with a small family and a few respectable
farm servants, could either permit a large and hungry
wolf to be continually peeping at midnight through the
keyhole of the nursery, or allow a brawny bruin to snuff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
too frequently under the kitchen door (after having
hugged the watch-dog to death) when the servant-maids
were at supper. The extirpation then of at least two of
these quondam British species became 'a work of necessity
and mercy,' and might have been tolerated even on a
Sunday, (between sermons,) especially as naturalists have
it still in their power to study the habits of similar wild
beasts, by no means yet extinct, in the neighbouring countries
of France and Germany."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the example of recent extinction most popularly
known is that of the Dodo, a very remarkable bird,
which about two centuries ago existed in considerable
abundance, in the isles of Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez.
It was a rather large fowl, incapable of rising
from the ground, by reason of the imperfect development
of its wings, of massive, uncouth figure, predisposed to
fatness, and noted for the sapidity of its flesh. Two
skulls and two unmatched feet of this strange bird are
preserved in European museums; and these shew that
its nearest affinities were with the pigeon-tribe, of which
we know some species of terrestrial habits, but none approaching
this bird in its absolute confinement to the
earth.</p>

<p>In the reports of numerous voyagers who visited these
islands from the end of the fifteenth century to the middle
of the seventeenth, we have many accounts of the appearance
and habits of this bird, evidently sketched from the
life. Some of the descriptions, as also the figures by which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
they are illustrated, are quaint enough; as, for example,
that graphic sketch hit off by old Sir Thomas Herbert,
who saw the bird in his travels in 1634:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Dodo," he says, "comes first to our description.
Here and in Dygarrois (and nowhere else that
I c<sup>d</sup> ever see or heare of) is generated the Dodo. (A
Portuguize name it is, and has reference to her simplenes)
a bird which for shape and rareness might be
call'd a Ph&oelig;nix (wer't in Arabia); her body is round
and extreame fat, her slow pace begets that corpulencie;
few of them weigh lesse than fifty pound:
better to the eye than the stomack: greasie appetites
may perhaps commend them, but, to the indifferently
curious, nourishment, but prove offensive. Let's take
her picture: her visage darts forth melancholy, as sensible
of nature's injurie in framing so great and massive
a body to be directed by such small and complementall
wings, as are unable to hoise her from the
ground, serving only to prove her a bird; which otherwise
might be doubted of: her head is variously drest,
the one halfe hooded with downy blackish feathers; the
other perfectly naked; of a whitish hue, as if a transparent
lawne had covered it; her bill is very howked
and bends downwards, the thrill or breathing place is
in the midst of it; from which part to the end, the
colour is a light greene mixt with a pale yellow; her
eyes be round and small, and bright as diamonds; her
cloathing is of finest downe, such as ye see in goslins;
her trayne is (like a China beard) of three or foure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>short feythers; her legs thick, and black, and strong;
her tallons or pounces sharp; her stomack fiery hot,
so as stones and yron are easilie digested in it; in that
and shape, not a little resembling the Africk oestriches:
but so much, as for their more certain dyfference I
dare to give thee (with two others) her representation."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p></div>

<p>It is pretty certain that a living specimen was about
the same time exhibited in England. Sir Hamon L'Estrange
tells us distinctly that he <i>saw</i> it. His original
MS. is preserved in the British Museum, and with some
blanks caused by the injury of time, of no great consequence,
reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"About 1638, as I walked London streets, I saw the
picture &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a strange fowl hong out upon a cloth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vas and myselfe with one or two more Gen. in
company went in to see it. It was kept in a chamber,
and was a greate fowle somewhat bigger than the largest
Turky Cock and so legged and footed but stouter and
thicker and of a more erect shape, coloured before like
the breast of a yong Cock Fesan and on the back of dunn
or deare coulour. The keeper called it a Dodo and in the
ende of a chimney in the chamber there lay an heap of
large pebble stones whereof hee gave it many in our sight,
some as bigg as nutmegs and the keeper told us shee eats
them conducing to digestion and though I remember not
how farre the keeper was questioned therein yet I am confident
that afterwards shee cast them all agayne."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>It is probable that this very specimen passed into the
museum of Tradescant, who, in the Catalogue of "The
Collection of Rarities preserved at Lambeth," dated 1656,
mentions the following: "Dodar from the Island Mauritius:
it is not able to flie being so bigg." Willoughby the
ornithologist, a most unexceptionable testimony, says that
he saw this specimen in Tradescant's museum: it is mentioned
also by others;&mdash;as by Llhwyd in 1684, and by
Hyde in 1700. It passed, with the rest of the Tradescant
Collection, to Oxford, and thus became part of the Ashmolean
Museum,&mdash;and being in a decayed condition, was
ordered to be destroyed by the authorities, who had no
apprehension of its value, in 1755. The skull and one
foot, however, were preserved, and are still in the Museum
at Oxford. Remains of the Dodo have been dug up in
the Mauritius, and are in the Paris Museum, and in that
of the Zoological Society of London. The bird certainly
does not exist there now, nor in either of the neighbouring
islands.</p>

<p>In the British Museum there is a fine original painting,
once the property of George Edwards, the celebrated bird
painter, representing the Dodo surrounded by other minor
birds and reptiles. Edwards states that "it was drawn
in Holland, from a living bird brought from St Maurice's
Island, in the East Indies. It was the property of Sir
Hans Sloane at the time of his death, and afterwards
becoming my property, I deposited it in the British
Museum as a great curiosity."</p>

<p>Professor Owen has discovered another original figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of this interesting form in Savary's painting of "Orpheus
and the Beasts," at the Hague. The figure, though small,
displays all the characteristic peculiarities, and agrees
well with Edwards' painting, while evincing that it was
copied from the living bird.</p>

<p>It is possible that there were two species of Dodo;
which would explain certain discrepancies in the descriptions
of observers. At all events we have here one, if
not more, conspicuous animal absolutely extinguished
within the last two hundred years.</p>

<p>Just about a century ago a great animal disappeared
from the ocean, which, according to Owen, was contemporary
with the fossil elephant and rhinoceros of Siberia
and England. Steller, a Russian voyager and naturalist,
discovered the creature, afterward called <i>Stelleria</i> by
Cuvier, in Behring's Straits; a huge, unwieldy whale-like
animal, one of the marine pachyderms, allied to the
Manatee, but much larger, being twenty-five feet long,
and twenty in circumference. Its flesh was good for food,
and from its inertness and incapacity for defence, the
race was extirpated in a few years. Steller first discovered
the species in 1741, and the last known specimen was
killed in 1768. It is believed to be quite extinct, as it
has never been met with since.</p>

<p>Nearly a century ago, Sonnerat found in Madagascar, a
curious animal, (<i>Cheiromys</i>,) which in structure seems to
connect the monkeys with the squirrels. So rare was it
there that even the natives viewed it with curiosity as
an animal altogether unknown to them; and, from their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
exclamations of astonishment rather than from its cry,
the French naturalist is said to have conferred upon it
the name of Aye-aye, by which it is now known. <i>Not a
specimen, as I believe, has been seen since Sonnerat's day</i>,
so that, if not actually obliterated, the species must be
on the verge of extinction.</p>

<p>Species are dying out in our own day. I have already
cited the interesting case of the Moho, that fine Gallinule
of New Zealand, of which a specimen&mdash;probably the last
of its race,&mdash;was obtained by Mr Walter Mantell; and that
of the K&aacute;ureke, the badger-like quadruped of the same
islands, which was formerly domesticated by the Maoris,
but which now cannot be found.</p>

<p>The Samoa Isles in the Pacific recently possessed a
large and handsome kind of pigeon, of richly-coloured
plumage, which the natives called <i>Manu-mea</i>, but to which
modern naturalists have given the name of <i>Didunculus
strigirostris</i>. It was, both by structure and habit, essentially
a ground pigeon, but not so exclusively but that it
fed, and roosted too, according to Lieut. Walpole, among
the branches of tall trees. Mr T. Peale, the naturalist of
the U. S. Exploring Expedition, who first described it, informs
us that according to the tradition of the natives, it
once abounded; but some years ago these persons, like
more civilised folks, had a strong desire to make pets of
cats, and found, by means of whale-ships, opportunities of
procuring a supply; but the consequence of the introduction
of "pussy,"&mdash;for under this familiar old-country
title were the exotic tabbies introduced&mdash;was the rapid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
diminution of the handsome <i>Manu-mea</i>. Pussy did not
fancy yams and taro&mdash;the vegetable diet on which the
natives regaled&mdash;and took to the woods and mountains to
search for something better. There she met with the
feeble-winged <i>Didunculus</i> scratching the soft earth for
seeds, and with a purr and a mew soon scraped acquaintance
with the stranger. Pussy declared she loved him well,
and so she did&mdash;too well, in fact; she felt "as if she could
eat him up,"&mdash;<i>and did</i>. The news soon spread among the
tabbies that there were sweet birds in the woods, and the
result is the almost total disappearance of poor <i>Manu-mea</i>.
Like the Dodo, it has ceased to be, but at the hand of a
more ignominious foe. The Samoan may truly say to his
former pet, "<i>Cecidisti, O Manu-mea, non manu me&acirc;, sed
ungue felino</i>." So rare had the bird become, that during
the stay of the Expedition only three specimens could be
procured, and of these two were lost by shipwreck. I do
not know whether another has been met with since. Probably
they are all gone; for that was twenty years ago.</p>

<p>When Norfolk Island,&mdash;that tiny spot in the Southern
Ocean since so stained with human crime and misery&mdash;was
first discovered, its tall and teeming forests were
tenanted by a remarkable Parrot with a very long and
slender hooked beak, which lived upon the honey of
flowers. It was named <i>Nestor productus</i>. When Mr
Gould visited Australia in his researches into the ornithology
of those antipodeal regions, he found the Nestor
Parrot absolutely limited to Philip Island, a tiny satellite
of Norfolk Island, whose whole circumference is not more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
than five miles in extent. The war of extermination had
been so successful in the larger island that, with the exception
of a few specimens preserved in cages, not one was
believed to survive. Since then its last retreat has been
harried, and Mr J. H. Gurney thus writes the dirge of the
last of the Nestors:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have seen the man who exterminated the <i>Nestor
productus</i> from Philip Island, he having shot the last of
that species left on the island; he informs me that they
rarely made use of their wings, except when closely pressed;
their mode of progression was by the upper mandible;
and whenever he used to go to the island to shoot, he
would invariably find them on the ground, except one,
which used to be sentry on one of the lower branches of
the <i>Araucaria excelsa</i>, and the instant any person landed,
they would run to those trees and haul themselves up by
the bill, and, as a matter of course, they would there
remain till they were shot, or the intruder had left the
island. He likewise informed me that there was a large
species of hawk that used to commit great havoc
amongst them, but what species it was he could not tell
me."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>I have before mentioned that Professor Owen had
recognised the species in fossil skulls from New Zealand,
associated with remains of <i>Dinornis</i>, <i>Palapteryx</i>, and
<i>Notornis</i>. Thus it appears that the long-billed Parrot is
an ancient race, whose extreme decrepitude has just survived
to our time;&mdash;that it first became extinct from New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Zealand, then from Norfolk Island, and lastly from Philip
Island. Peace to its ashes!</p>

<p>Mr Yarrell, in his "History of British Birds,"<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> commences
his account of one of them in these words:&mdash;"The
Great Auk is a very rare British Bird, and but few
instances are recorded of its capture. The natives in the
Orkneys informed Mr Bullock, on his tour through these
islands several years ago, that only one male had made its
appearance for a long time, which had regularly visited
Papa Westra for several seasons. The female, which the
natives call the queen of the Auks, was killed just before
Mr Bullock's arrival. The king or male, Mr Bullock had
the pleasure of chasing for several hours in a six-oared
boat, but without being able to kill him, for though he
frequently got near him, so expert was the bird in its
natural element that it appeared impossible to shoot him.
The rapidity with which he pursued his course under
water was almost incredible. About a fortnight after Mr
Bullock had left Papa Westra, this male bird was obtained
and sent him, and at the sale of his collection, was purchased
for the British Museum, where it is still carefully
preserved."</p>

<p>This fine bird, which was larger than a goose, is believed
to be extinct. Mr Bullock's specimen was taken in 1812;
another was captured at St Kilda in 1822, another was
picked up dead near Lundy Island in 1829, and yet
another was taken in 1834, off the coast of Waterford.</p>

<p>On the north coast of Europe the bird is equally rare;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
not more than two or three, at the utmost, having been
procured during the present century. During that period,
however, it has haunted one or two breeding-rocks on the
south coast of Iceland, in some abundance. In the years
1830 and 1831, as many as twenty-seven were obtained
there, and from that time till 1840, about ten more. The
last birds obtained on the Iceland coast were a pair, which
were shot on their nest in 1844. The last taken in any
locality, so far as is known, was one shot in 1848, by a
peasant, on the Island of Wardoe, within the Arctic
Circle.</p>

<p>Two centuries ago, the Great Auk was not uncommon
on the shores of New England; and, off the great fishing-banks
of Newfoundland, it appears to have been very
abundant. "Its appearance was always hailed by the
mariner approaching that desolate coast as the first indication
of his having reached soundings on the fishing-banks.
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries these
waters, as well as the Iceland and Faroe coasts, were
annually visited by hundreds of ships from England,
France, Spain, Holland, and Portugal; and these ships
actually were accustomed to provision themselves with
the bodies and eggs of these birds, which they found
breeding in myriads on the low islands off the coast
of Newfoundland. Besides the fresh birds consumed by
the ship's crew, many tons were salted down for further
use. In the space of an hour, these old voyagers tell us,
they could fill thirty boats with the birds. It was only
necessary to go on shore, armed with sticks to kill as many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as they chose. The birds were so stupid that they allowed
themselves to be taken up, on their own proper element,
by boats under sail; and it is even said that on putting
out a plank it was possible to drive the Great Auks up
and out of the sea into boats. On land the sailors formed
low enclosures of stones, into which they drove the Penguins
[or Auks], and, as they were unable to fly, kept them
there enclosed till they were wanted for the table."</p>

<p>"In 1841, a distinguished Norwegian naturalist, (too
early, alas! lost to science,) Peter Stuwitz, visited Tunk
Island, or Penguin Island, lying to the east of Newfoundland.
Here, on the north-west shore of the island, he
found enormous heaps of bones and skeletons of the Great
Auk, lying either in exposed masses or slightly covered
by the earth. On this side of the island the rocks slope
gradually down to the shore; and here were still standing
the stone fences and enclosures into which the birds were
driven for slaughter."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>It is just possible that the bird may yet haunt the inaccessible
coast of East Greenland, but ships sailing between
that country and Iceland never meet with it at sea.
Nor did Graah observe it during his toilsome researches
east of Cape Farewell. The numerous fishing craft that
every season crowd the shores of Newfoundland and
Labrador forbid the notion that it yet lingers there; for
the great market-value set upon the bird and its eggs
for collections would prevent its existence there from
being overlooked. The numerous Polar voyages of dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>covery,
and the annual fleets of whalers, would certainly
have discovered it, if it still haunted the more northern
regions. It is possible that a few isolated individuals
may still survive; but it is the habit of the bird, as of
most sea-fowl, to breed in society in bare seaward rocks,
and the circumstance that no breeding station is known
to be now frequented by the Great Auk renders it but
too probable that it also must be classed among the
species that were.</p>

<p>The interest attached to this now extinct bird has induced
some correspondents of the <i>Zoologist</i> to attempt
an enumeration of the specimens, both of the bird and of
its eggs, (which from their great size, as well as from their
rarity, have always had a value with collectors,) known to
be preserved in cabinets. The result is that English collections
contain 14 birds and 23 eggs; those of continental
Europe, 11 birds and 20 eggs; the United States,
1 bird and 2 eggs:&mdash;the total being 26 birds and 45
eggs.</p>

<p>It would appear that the rock off the south of Iceland
which was the chief breeding resort of the Great Auk,
and which from that circumstance bore the name or
"Geir-fulga Sker," sank to the level of the sea during a
volcanic disturbance in or about the year 1830. "Such
disappearance of the fit and favourable breeding-places of
the <i>Alca impennis</i>," observes Professor Owen, "must
form an important element in its decline towards extinction."
One might think that there would be rocks
enough left for the birds to choose a fresh station; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
really we do not know what are the elements of choice in
such a case: some peculiarities exist which make one particular
rock to be selected by sea-fowl, when others apparently
to us as suitable are quite neglected; but we do not
know what they are. Possibly when Geir-fulga Sker
sank, there was no other islet fit to supply the blank.
Possibly, too, the submersion took place during the breeding
season, drowning the eggs or young. If this was the
case, it would indeed be "a heavy blow and great discouragement"
to the dwindling Alcine nation.</p>

<p>Mr Darwin speaks of a large wolf-like Fox (<i>Canis antarcticus</i>)
which at the time of his voyage was common to
both the Falkland Islands, but absolutely confined to
them. He says, "As far as I am aware, there is no other
instance in any part of the world, of so small a mass of
broken land, distant from a continent, possessing so
large an aboriginal quadruped peculiar to itself. Their
numbers have rapidly decreased; they are already banished
from that half of the island which lies to the eastward
of the neck of land between St Salvador Bay and
Berkeley Sound. Within a very few years after these
islands shall have become regularly settled, in all probability
this fox will be classed with the Dodo, as an animal
which has perished from the face of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The Musk Ox (<i>Ovibos moschatus</i>), a long-haired ruminant,
resembling what you would suppose a cross between
a bull and a sheep might be,&mdash;formerly an inhabitant of
Britain with the Elephant and the Hyena, but now found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
only on the polar margins of North America,&mdash;is becoming
very scarce; and it is probable that before long its last
representative will leave its bones with those of the lamented
Franklin and his companions.</p>

<p>From the more perishable character of vegetable tissues
we have far less data for determining the extinction of
plant species; but analogy renders it highly probable that
these also have died out, and are dying in a corresponding
ratio with animals. I am not aware that a single
example can be adduced of a plant that has certainly
ceased to exist during the historic era. But Humboldt
mentions a very remarkable tree in Mexico, of which it is
believed only a single specimen remains in a state of
nature. It is the Hand-tree (<i>Cheirostemon platanoides</i>),
a sterculaceous plant with large plane-like leaves, and with
the anthers connected together in such a manner as to
resemble a hand or claw rising from the beautiful purplish-red
blossoms. "There is in all the Mexican free
States only one individual remaining, one single primeval
stem of this wonderful genus. It is supposed not to be
indigenous, but to have been planted by a king of Toluca
about five hundred years ago. I found that the spot
where the Arbol de las Manitas stands is 8825 feet above
the level of the sea. Why is there only one tree of the
kind? Whence did the kings of Toluca obtain the young
tree, or the seed? It is equally enigmatical that Montezuma
should not have possessed one of these trees in his
botanical gardens of Huaxtepec, Chapoltepec, and Iztapalapan,
which were used as late as by Philip the Second's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
physician, Hernandez, and of which gardens traces still
remain; and it appears no less striking that the Hand-tree
should not have found a place among the drawings of
subjects connected with Natural History, which Nezahual
Coyotl, king of Tezcuco, caused to be made half a century
before the arrival of the Spaniards."</p>

<p>There is an example of this interesting plant growing
in one of the conservatories at Kew, but I do not know
whence it was obtained. It has been asserted that it
grows wild in the forests of Guatemala.</p>

<p>Leaving plants out of consideration from lack of adequate
data, we find that a considerable number of species
of animals have certainly ceased to exist since man inhabited
the globe. There have been, doubtless, many others
that have shared the same fate, which we know nothing
about. It is only within the last hundred years that we
have had anything approaching to an acquaintance with
the living fauna of the earth; yet, during that time some
seven or eight creatures we know have been extinguished.
Fully half of these,&mdash;the Auk, the Didunculus, the
Notornis, and the Nestor,&mdash;within the last ten years! It
would really seem as if the more complete and comprehensive
an acquaintance with the animals of the world
became, the more frequently this strange phenomenon of
expiring species was presented to us. Perhaps it is not
extravagant to suppose that&mdash;including all the invertebrate
animals, the countless hosts of insects, and all the
recondite forms that dwell in the recesses of the ocean&mdash;a
species fades from existence every year. All the examples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
that have been given were either Mammalia or Birds, (<i>the
Colossochelys</i> only excepted:) now these, though the most
conspicuous and best known, are almost the least populous
classes of living beings. There is no reason whatever for
concluding that the law of mortality of species does not
extend to all the other classes, vertebrate and invertebrate,
in an equal ratio, so that my estimate will appear, I think,
a very moderate one. Yet it is a startling thought, and
one which the mind does not entertain without a measure
of revulsion, that the passing of every century in the
world's history has left its fauna <i>minus</i> a hundred species
of animals that were denizens of the earth when it began.
I was going to say "left the fauna so much <i>poorer</i>;" but
that I am not sure of. The term would imply that the
blanks are not filled up; and that, I repeat, I am not
sure of. Probability would suggest that new forms are
continually created to supply the lack of deceased ones;
and it may be that <i>some</i>, at least, of the creatures ever
and anon described as new to science, especially in old
and well-searched regions, may be newly called into being,
as well as newly discovered. It may be so, I say; I
have no evidence that it is so, except the probability
of analogy; we know that the rate of mortality among
<i>individuals</i> of a species, speaking generally, is equalled
by the rate of birth, and we may suppose this balance
of life to be paralleled when the unit is a species, and
not an individual. If the Word of God contained anything
either in statement or principle contrary to such
a supposition, I would not entertain it for a moment, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
I do not know that it does. I do not know that it is anywhere
implied that God created no more after the six
days' work was done. His Sabbath-rest having been
broken by the incoming of sin, we know from John v. 17,
that He continued to work without interruption; and we
may fairly conclude that progressive creation was included
as a part of that unceasing work.</p>

<p>I know not whether my readers will take the same
concern as I do in this subject of the dying-out of species,
but to me it possesses a very peculiar interest. Death is
a mysterious event, come when and how it will; and
surely the departure from existence of a species, of a type
of being, that has subsisted in contemporary thousands of
individuals, for thousands of years, is not less imposingly
mysterious than that of the individual exemplar.</p>

<p>We do not know with any precision what are the immediate
causes of death in a species. Is there a definite
limit to life imposed at first? or is this limit left, so to
speak, to be determined by accidental circumstances?
Perhaps both: but if the latter, what are those circumstances?</p>

<p>Professor Owen says:&mdash;"There are characters in land
animals rendering them more obnoxious to extirpating
influences, which may explain why so many of the larger
species of particular groups have become extinct, whilst
smaller species of equal antiquity have survived. In proportion
to its bulk is the difficulty of the contest which
the animal has to maintain against the surrounding agencies
that are ever tending to dissolve the vital bond, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
subjugate the living matter to the ordinary chemical and
physical forces. Any changes, therefore, in such external
agencies as a species may have been originally adapted to
exist in, will militate against that existence in a degree
proportionate to the size which may characterise the
species. If a dry season be gradually prolonged, the large
mammal will suffer from the drought sooner than the
small one; if such alteration of climate affect the quantity
of vegetable food, the bulky herbivore will first feel the
effects of stinted nourishment; if new enemies be introduced,
the large and conspicuous animal will fall a prey
while the smaller kinds conceal themselves and escape.
Small quadrupeds, moreover, are more prolific than large
ones. Those of the bulk of the mastodons, megatheria,
glyptodons, and diprotodons, are uniparous. The actual
presence, therefore, of small species of animals in countries
where larger species of the same natural families
formerly existed, is not the consequence of degeneration&mdash;of
any gradual diminution of the size&mdash;of such species,
but is the result of circumstances which may be illustrated
by the fable of 'the Oak and the Reed;' the
smaller and feebler animals have bent and accommodated
themselves to changes to which the larger species have
succumbed."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>"We do not steadily bear in mind," remarks Mr Darwin,
"how profoundly ignorant we are of the condition of
existence of every animal; nor do we always remember
that some check is constantly preventing the too rapid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
increase of every organised being left in a state of nature.
The supply of food, on an average, remains constant; yet
the tendency in every animal to increase by propagation
is geometrical; and its surprising effects have nowhere
been more astonishingly shewn, than in the case of the
European animals run wild during the last few centuries
in America. Every animal in a state of nature regularly
breeds; yet in a species long established, any <i>great</i> increase
in numbers is obviously impossible, and must be checked
by some means. We are nevertheless seldom able with
certainty to tell in any given species, at what period of
life, or at what period of the year, or whether only at
long intervals, the check falls; or again, what is the precise
nature of the check. Hence probably it is, that we
feel so little surprise at one, of two species closely allied
in habits, being rare and the other abundant in the same
district; or again, that one should be abundant in one
district, and another, filling the same place in the economy
of nature, should be abundant in a neighbouring district,
differing very little in its conditions. If asked how this
is, one immediately replies that it is determined by some
slight difference in climate, food, or the number of enemies:
yet how rarely, if ever, we can point out the precise
cause and manner of action of the check! We are,
therefore, driven to the conclusion that causes generally
quite inappreciable by us, determine whether a given
species shall be abundant or scanty in numbers.</p>

<p>"In the cases where we can trace the extinction of a
species through man, either wholly or in one limited dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>trict,
we know that it becomes rarer and rarer, and is then
lost; it would be difficult to point out any just distinction
between a species destroyed by man or by the increase of
its natural enemies. The evidence of rarity preceding extinction,
is more striking in the successive tertiary strata,
as remarked by several able observers; it has often been
found that a shell very common in a tertiary stratum is now
most rare, and has even long been thought to be extinct.
If, then, as appears probable, species first become rare and
then extinct&mdash;if the too rapid increase of every species,
even the most favoured, is steadily checked, as we must
admit, though how and when it is hard to say&mdash;and if we
see, without the smallest surprise, though unable to assign
the precise reason, one species abundant, and another
closely-allied species rare in the same district&mdash;why should
we feel such great astonishment at the rarity being carried
a step further to extinction? An action going on, on
every side of us, and yet barely appreciable, might surely
be carried a little further, without exciting our observation.
Who could feel any great surprise at hearing
that the Megalonyx was formerly rare compared with the
Megatherium, or that one of the fossil Monkeys was few
in number compared with one of the now living Monkeys?
and yet, in this comparative rarity, we should have the
plainest evidence of less favourable conditions for their
existence. To admit that species generally become rare
before they become extinct&mdash;to feel no surprise at the
comparative rarity of one species with another, and yet to
call in some extraordinary agent and to marvel greatly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
when a species ceases to exist, appears to me much the
same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the prelude
of death&mdash;to feel no surprise at sickness&mdash;but when
the sick man dies to wonder, and to believe that he died
through violence."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Geographical distribution is an important element in
this question of extinction. A species that is spread over
a wide region is far more likely to survive than one which
is confined to a limited district; and extraneous influences
acting prejudicially will exterminate a species which is
confined to an island much sooner than if it had a continent
to retire upon. We have seen how the <i>Nestor</i> Parrot
became extinct in New Zealand, while it survived in
Norfolk Island, because the former was colonised by the
Maori race, while the latter remained in its virginity.
But how quickly did the poor Parrot succumb as soon as
man set his foot on Norfolk and Philip Islands! And
how brief was the lease of life accorded to the <i>Didunculus</i>,
when once the "Pussies" found their way to the little
Samoa isles!</p>

<p>Very many islands have a fauna that is to a great
extent peculiar to themselves. I know that, in Jamaica,
the Humming-birds, some of the Parrots, some of the
Cuckoos, most of the Pigeons, many of the smaller birds,
and, I think, all of the Reptiles, are found nowhere else.
Nay, more, that even the smaller islands of the Antilles
have each a fauna of its own, unshared with any other
land;&mdash;its own Humming-birds, its own Lizards and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>Snakes; its own Butterflies and Beetles, its own Spiders,
its own Snails, its own Worms. How likely are some of
these very limited species to become extinguished! By
the increasing aggressions of clearing and cultivating
man; by slight changes of level; even by electric and
meteoric phenomena acting very locally. I find that, in
Jamaica, many of the animals peculiar to the island are
not spread over the whole surface, limited as that is, but
are confined to a single small district. In some cases,
the individuals are but few, even in that favoured locality;
how easily we may conceive of a season drier than ordinary,
or wetter than ordinary, or a flood, or a hurricane of
unusual violence, or a volcanic eruption, either killing
outright these few individuals, or destroying their means
of living, and so indirectly destroying them by starvation.
And then the species has disappeared!</p>

<p>The common Red Grouse, so abundantly seen during
the season hanging at every poulterer's and game-dealer's
shop in London, is absolutely unknown out of the British
Isles. It could not live except in wide, unenclosed, uncultivated
districts; so that when the period arrives that
the whole of British land is enclosed and brought under
cultivation, the Grouse's lease of life will expire. We
owe it to our hard-worked members of Parliament to
hope that this condition of things may be distant.</p>

<h2>THE MARVELLOUS.</h2>


<p>The vulgar mind is very prone to love the marvellous,
and to count for a prodigy every unusual phenomenon,
every occurrence not perfectly accountable on any hypothesis
which is familiar to them. The poetical period of
history in every country is full of prodigies; for in the
dawn of civilisation the physical laws of nature are little
understood, and multitudes of natural phenomena are
either referred to false causes, or, being unreferrible to any
recognised cause, are set down as mere wonders. It is
the province of science to dispel these delusions, to expose
the undiscovered, but by no means undiscoverable, origins
of unusual events, and thus to be continually narrowing
the limits of the unknown. These limits, however, have
not even yet quite reached the minuteness of a mathematical
point; and there are a few marvels left for the
indefatigable rummagings of modern science to explain.</p>

<p>Perhaps the predominant tendency of uneducated minds
in the present day is rather to attribute effects to <i>false</i>
causes, than to leave them without any assignable cause.
It is much easier for an unreasoning person to say that
Tenterden steeple is the cause of Goodwin Sands, than to
leave Goodwin Sands quite unaccounted for; or to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the plant-lice suddenly appear crowding the rose-twigs,
"the east wind has cast a blight," or "it is something in
the air," than "I do not know how to account for their
appearance." To a reflecting person, indeed, who weighs
forces, the east wind appears as incompetent to the production
of living animals as the tall tower to the origination
of a sand-bank; and this, though he might be able
to suggest nothing a whit more competent. What should
he do in such a case? Manifestly this&mdash;test the actual
existence and conditions of the phenomenon; see that it
really has occurred; and, if the fact cannot be denied,
admit it as a fact, and wait further light as to its causation.</p>

<p>I do not by any means presume to declare the universal
"why and because" of every familiar or unfamiliar
occurrence: I leave that to more pretentious philosophers;
smiling occasionally in my sleeve at the egotism
which cannot see its own <i>non-sequiturs</i>. But still less
can I consent to set aside every phenomenon which I
cannot explain, with the common resource,&mdash;"Pooh!
pooh! there must be some mistake!" Rather would I
say, "There must still be some ignorance in me: near as I
have reached to the summit of the ladder of knowledge,
there must be still one or two rongs to be mounted before
I can proclaim my mastery of all, absolutely <i>all</i>, the
occult causes of things. Therefore, till then I must be
content with the lowlier task of patiently accumulating
evidence."</p>

<p>At various times and in various places popular super<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>stition
has been excited by the occurrence of what have
been called showers of blood. The destruction of cities
and of kingdoms has been, according to historians, preceded
by this awful omen. Yet this has been explained
by a very natural and accountable phenomenon. In the
year 1553, the hedges and trees, the stones of the pathway,
and the clothes of many persons, were sprinkled
copiously with drops of red fluid, which was supposed to
be blood, till some observant person noticed the coincident
appearance of unusual swarms of butterflies, and marked
that the coloured drops proceeded from them. Again, at
Aix la Chapelle in 1608, the same awful appearance occurred,
especially on the walls of a particular churchyard.
M. Peiresc, an able naturalist, residing at Aix, traced the
phenomenon here to the same cause. Just before, he had
found a large chrysalis, which he had enclosed in a box,
in order to identify the species to which it belonged. A
few days after, hearing a rustling, he opened the box, and
discovered a beautiful butterfly evolved from the pupa,
which had left upon the floor of its prison a large red
stain. He saw that the character of this deposit agreed
exactly with that of the ominous drops abroad, and remarking
an unusual abundance of the same kind of butterfly,
he conceived that he had revealed the cause of the
terrific phenomenon. He was confirmed in this belief by
the circumstance that the supposed blood-drops were not
found in the streets of the town, nor upon the roofs of
the houses, where they must have occurred had they
fallen from the sky; and, moreover, that it was rare to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
any on the exposed parts of stones, walls, &amp;c.; but rather
under the protection of angles, and in slight cavities&mdash;which
agrees well with the habits of the insects in question.
No doubt this was the true explanation of the
phenomenon, but it does not say much for the powers of
observation which could have attributed it to blood, for
the colour is by no means that of blood, especially <i>dried</i>
blood, but much more crimson; and the earthy deposit,
resembling chalk, which copiously remains after the fluid
part has evaporated, would in a moment convince any one
who was in the habit of comparing things which differ, that,
whatever the substance was, blood it certainly was not.</p>

<p>I myself not long ago met with an appearance which
bore a much closer resemblance to drops of blood than
this, and which yet was referrible to a widely different
origin. In the neighbourhood of Ashburton, in Devon, a
quarter of a mile or so from the town, there is a shallow
horse-pond, the bottom of which consists of an impalpable
whitish mud, much indented with hoof-holes and other
irregularities. In these, the water being dimly clear from
settlement, I observed what looked exactly like blood, in
numerous patches, the appearance being as if two or three
drops of blood had fallen in one spot, half-a-dozen in
another, and so on. The colour was true, and even when
I alighted, and looked carefully on the spots, they had
just that curdled appearance that drops of blood assume
when they fall into still water. But there appeared on
minute examination a constant intestine motion in each
spot, which caused me to bring my eye closer, when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
discovered that I had been egregiously deceived. Each
apparent drop of blood was formed of a number of slender
worms, about as thick as a hog's bristle, and an inch and
a half long, of a red hue, which protruded the greater
part of their length from the mud, in a radiating form,
each maintaining a constant undulatory movement. There
were more or fewer centres of radiation, the circles frequently
interrupted by, and merging into, others, just as
drops of blood crowded together would do. On the
slightest disturbance the little actors shrank out of sight
into the soft mud; but by scooping up a little of this I
contrived to get a number of them into a phial, which, as
the sediment settled, were seen at the bottom playing as if
in their pond. On examination of the specimens with a
microscope I found them to be minute Annelids, such as
I have described, apparently of the genus <i>Lumbriculus</i> of
Grube, with two rows of bristle-pencils, and two bristles
in a pencil. The body was transparent and colourless,
and the red hue was given by the great and conspicuous
longitudinal blood-vessels, and by the lateral connecting
vessels, which viewed sidewise took the form of loops.
The animals soon died in captivity, but I kept some for
three or four days alive.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere referred to the curious phenomenon of
crimson snow, and to the uncertainty which still hangs
over its cause. I have lately met with another explanation,
which seems sufficiently guaranteed to be depended
on, though, as the red snow occurs in places where this
cause cannot operate, it only shews that similar results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
may be produced by diverse agencies. A certain resemblance
between the facts and those adduced by M. Peiresc
will warrant my quoting them. Mr Thomas Nicholson,
in a visit to Sowallik Point, in Prince Regent's Inlet, thus
describes what he saw:&mdash;"The summit of the hill forming
the point is covered with huge masses of granite, while
the side, which forms a gentle declivity towards the bay,
was covered with crimson snow. It was evident, at first
view, that this colour was imparted to the snow by a substance
lying on the surface. This substance lay scattered
here and there in small masses bearing some resemblance
to powdered cochineal, surrounded by a lighter shade,
which was produced by the colouring matter being partly
dissolved and diffused by the deliquescent snow. During
this examination our hats and upper garments were observed
to be daubed with a substance of a similar red
colour; and a moment's reflection convinced us that this
was the excrement of the little Auk, myriads of which bird
were continually flying over our heads, having their
nests among the loose masses of granite. A ready explanation
of the origin of the red snow was now presented to
us, and not a doubt remained in the mind of any of us
that this was the correct one. The snow on the mountains
of higher elevation than the nests of these birds was
perfectly white; and a ravine at a short distance, which
was filled with snow from top to bottom, but which
afforded no hiding-place for these birds to form their
nests, presented an appearance uniformly white."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>After all, however, real <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> rain does sometimes
descend, which, if not blood-red, is at least red. "M.
Giovanni Campani, Professor of Chemistry at the University
of Siena, has just published a letter, addressed to Professor
Matteucci, on a most singular phenomenon which
occurred at Siena in December last. On the 28th of that
month, about seven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the inhabitants of the northwestern
part of the city witnessed with surprise the curious
phenomenon of a copious fall of rain of a reddish hue,
which lasted two hours; a second shower of the same
colour occurred at eleven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and a third at two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
but that of the deepest red fell the first time. But what
adds to the strangeness of the occurrence is that it was
entirely confined to that particular quarter of the town,
and so nicely was the line drawn that the cessation of the
red colour was ascertained in one direction to be at about
two hundred m&egrave;tres from the meteorological observatory,
the pluviometer of which received colourless rain at exactly
the same time. The temperature during the same interval
varied between 8 deg. and 10 deg. Centigrade (46 and
50 Fahrenheit). The wind blew from the S.W. at the
beginning of the phenomenon, and afterwards changed to
W.S.W. None of the rural population in the immediate
vicinity of Siena remarked the occurrence, so that most
probably the rain that fell round the town was colourless.
The same phenomenon, strange to say, recurred in exactly
the same quarter of the town on the 31st of December,
and again on the 1st of January, the wind being W.N.W.,
and the temperature respectively 35 and 39&middot;42 deg.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Fahrenheit. Each time, however, the red colour diminished
in depth, its greatest strength having at no time
exceeded that of weak wine and water. A similar occurrence
is recorded as having taken place in 1819 at
Blankenburg, when MM. Meyer and Stopp found the
water to contain a solution of chloride of cobalt. Professor
Campani, who is now engaged, in conjunction with his
colleague, Professor Gabrielli, in analyzing the red water
collected, has ascertained that in this instance it contains
no chloride of cobalt, and, moreover, that the colour must
be owing to some solution, since the water has deposited
no sediment."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The occasional occurrence of large masses of water
stained of a vivid red hue, and for the most part suddenly,
and without any ostensible cause, has not unreasonably
been recorded as a prodigy, rivalling one of
the plagues of Egypt&mdash;the turning of the waters into
blood.</p>

<p>"I remember," says Mr Latrobe, "the report reaching
Neufchatel, through the medium of the market-people
passing from the one lake to the other, (some time during
the winter,) that the waters of the lake of Morat had
suddenly become the colour of blood, though I could
meet with no one whose testimony was sufficiently clear
and unequivocal to establish the fact. This, joined to
my not having the leisure then to go and see for myself,
caused the matter to slip from my memory entirely,
till I found myself in the neighbourhood. Here the cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>cumstance
was fully confirmed to me in a manner not
to be questioned; and having since met with a paper,
written by M. de Candolle, of Geneva, on the subject, I
shall take what is there stated as my best guide in
mentioning the facts as they occurred:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It appears that this singular phenomenon began to
excite the attention of the inhabitants of Morat as early
as November last year, and that it continued more or less
observable during the whole of the winter.</p>

<p>"Mr Trechsel, a gentleman resident at Morat, to whom
M. de Candolle applied, on hearing the report, for information
and specimens of the colouring matter, stated&mdash;That
during the early hours of the day no extraordinary
appearance was observable in the lake; but that a little
later, long parallel lines of reddish matter were seen to
extend along the surface of the water, at some short distance
from the banks. This, being blown by the wind
towards the more sheltered parts of the shore, collected
itself about the reeds and rushes, covering the surface of
the lake with a light foam; forming as it were different
strata of various colours, from greenish black, grey, yellow,
and brown, to the most delicious red. He adds, that this
matter exhaled a pestiferous odour during the day, but
disappeared at the approach of night. It was further
observed, that during tempestuous weather it vanished
altogether. Many small fishes were seen to become intoxicated
while swimming amongst it, and after a few
convulsive leaps, to lie motionless on the surface.</p>

<p>"The naturalists of Geneva decided, from the specimens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
sent, that it was an animal substance, which, if not the
<i>Oscillatoria subfusca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> was nearly allied to it.</p>

<p>"Soon after the beginning of May it disappeared
entirely. It is not known that this phenomenon has
appeared before in the lake of Morat within the memory
of man. Tradition states the same to have happened the
year preceding the great battle."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>A few years ago, in one of my tanks of sea-water, there
occurred a phenomenon much like this. Patches of a
rich crimson-purple colour formed here and there on the
surface, which rapidly grew on all sides till they coalesced.
If allowed to be a few days undisturbed, the entire surface
of the water became covered with a pellicle of the
substance, which spread also over the stones and shells of
the bottom, and the sides of the vessel. It could be lifted
in impalpable lamin&aelig; on sheets of paper. I found it difficult
to keep it within bounds, and impossible to get quite
rid of it, till, after some months, I lost it by the accidental
breaking of the vessel. Under the microscope, this proved
an <i>Oscillatoria</i>, which I could not identify with any of
the described species in Harvey's <i>Phytologia</i>: the filaments
creeping and twining with the peculiar vermicular
movements of the genus.</p>

<p>Blood-like waters are sometimes produced by a rapid
evolution of infusorial animalcules. Of these the most
effective are <i>Astasia h&aelig;matodes</i>, and <i>Euglena sanguinea</i>;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>both of them minute spindle-shaped creatures of a pulpy
substance, and sanguine hue. They are produced occasionally
in incalculable numbers, increasing with vast
rapidity by means of spontaneous division. Ehrenberg
suggests that the miracle of blood-change performed on
the Nile and on all other collections of water in Egypt by
Moses (Exod. vii. 17-25) may have been effected by the
agency of these animalcules. Of course it would require
Divine power as much to educe uncounted millions of
animalcules at the word of command, as to form real
blood, so that no escape from the presence of Deity would
be gained by admitting the supposition; but the words of
the inspired narrative seem to render it untenable.</p>

<p>To return to showers. "If it should rain cats and
dogs,"&mdash;is a phrase which is in many mouths; but probably
no one has heard it transferred from the subjunctive
to the indicative mood. Why not, however, if it
rains snails, frogs, fishes, and feathers? That these
animals and animal products are really poured down
from the atmosphere, I can adduce some evidence; the
value of which my readers may weigh when they have
heard the pleadings.</p>

<p>In that venerable newspaper, <i>Felix Farley's Journal</i>,
for July 1821, there was "an account of a wonderful
quantity of snail-shells found in a piece of land of several
acres near Bristol, that common report says fell in a
shower." This shell-storm attracting much attention at
the time, Mr Wm. Baker, of Bridgewater, asked information
from the Curator of the Bristol Institution, who thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
cleared up the mystery:&mdash;"The periwinkles are indeed
wonderful. They descended, forsooth, in a heavy rain-like
shower on the field of Mr Peach, as a due punishment
for his disrespect to the virtues of our late queen.
The shower was so intense, that the umbrella of an old
lady passing by was broken to pieces, and the fragments
lifted in the air by the whirlwind, which picked up all the
periwinkles on the neighbouring hills, and dropped them
three inches thick on Mr Peach's field! But you know
the story of 'The Three Black Crows;' and thus the
whole is reduced to no periwinkle rain, no whirlwind;
but turns out to be our old friend <i>Helix virgata</i>, making
its annual pilgrimage in search of a mate, and occurring
one in almost every square inch in the field in question."</p>

<p>Provincial newspapers seem to have a special power of
reporting such natural history facts, which rarely survive
investigation. The <i>Stroud Free Press</i>, for May 23,
1851, tells us that "an extraordinary scene was witnessed
at Bradford, about twelve miles from Bristol, on Saturday
week, when that village was visited by a heavy shower of
snails. They might have been gathered by bushels." Mr
J. W. Douglas, the eminent entomologist, immediately
asked some pertinent questions anent the shower; but
whether it was that the witnesses were grieved at his profanely
comparing such prodigies to Professors Morison and
Holloway's cures, or whether they had no more definite
intelligence to communicate, <i>certes</i> echo answered not.</p>

<p>We fear we must give up snails. But frogs! everybody
knows that toads and frogs fall from the sky. According<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to travellers in tropical America, the inhabitants of Portobello
assert that every drop of rain is changed into a toad;
the more instructed, however, believe that the spawn of
these animals is raised with the vapour from the adjoining
swamps, and being driven in the clouds over the city, the
ova are hatched as they descend in rain. 'Tis certain that
the streets after a night of heavy rain are almost covered
with the ill-favoured reptiles, and it is impossible to walk
without crushing them.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But heretic philosophers point to
the mature growth of the vermin, many of them being six
inches in length, and maintain that the clever hypothesis
just mentioned will scarcely account for the appearance of
these.</p>

<p>In the <i>Leeds Mercury</i> for June 1844, there occurred
the following statement:&mdash;"In the course of the afternoon
of Monday last, during the prevalence of rather heavy
rain, the good people of Selby were astonished at a remarkable
phenomenon. It was rendered forcibly apparent,
that, with the descent of the rain, there was a shower of
another description, viz. a shower of frogs. The truth of
this was rendered more manifest by the circumstance that
several of the frogs were caught in their descent by holding
out hats for that purpose. They were about the size
of a horse-bean, and remarkably lively after their aerial
but wingless flight. The same phenomenon was observed
in the immediate neighbourhood."</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Zoologist</i> immediately asked for confirmation
of the stated facts, from resident persons of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>science; but notwithstanding the circumstantiality of the
account, and especially the reported actual capture of the
little sprawlers in hats, no one replied to the demand,
and we are compelled to conclude that the report would
not bear critical investigation.</p>

<p>Yet incredulity may be pushed too far even here. For,
in the continental journals many more such statements
occur than in those of this country, and some of them
vouched by apparently indisputable authority. If my
readers will refer to <i>L'Institut.</i> tom. ii. (1834) pp. 337,
346, 347, 353, 354, 386, 409; tom. iv. (1836) pp. 221,
314, 325; tom. vi. (1838) p. 212, they will find mention
made of this phenomenon,&mdash;showers of toads. In two or
three of these cases, the toads were not only observed in
countless numbers on the ground, during, and after, heavy
storms of rain, but were seen to strike upon the roofs of
houses, bounding thence into the streets; they even fell
upon the hats, umbrellas, and clothes of the observers, who
were out in the storm, and, in one instance, were actually
received into the outstretched hand.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Much more recently, namely, early in 1859, the newspapers
of South Wales recorded a shower of fish in the
Valley of Aberdare. The repeated statements attracted
more notice than usual, and the Rev. John Griffith, the
vicar of the parish, communicated the following results of
his inquiries to the <i>Evening Mail</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many of your readers might, perhaps, like to see the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>facts connected with this phenomenon. They will be
better understood in the words of the principal witness, as
taken down by me on the spot where it happened. This
man's name is John Lewis, a sawyer in Messrs Nixon and
Co.'s yard. His evidence is as follows:&mdash;'On Wednesday,
February 9, I was getting out a piece of timber for the
purpose of setting it for the saw, when I was startled by
something falling all over me&mdash;down my neck, on my
head, and on my back. On putting my hand down my
neck I was surprised to find they were little fish. By this
time I saw the whole ground covered with them. I took
off my hat, the brim of which was full of them. They were
jumping all about. They covered the ground in a long
strip of about eighty yards by twelve, as we measured afterwards.
That shed (pointing to a very large workshop)
was covered with them, and the shoots were quite full of
them. My mates and I might have gathered bucketfuls
of them, scraping with our hands. We did gather a great
many, about a bucketful, and threw them into the rain-pool,
where some of them now are. There were two
showers, with an interval of about ten minutes, and each
shower lasted about two minutes or thereabouts. The
time was eleven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> The morning up-train to Aberdare
was just then passing. It was not blowing very
hard, but uncommon wet, just about the same wind as
there is to-day (blowing rather stiff), and it came from
this quarter (pointing to the S. of W.). They came down
with the rain in "a body, like."' Such is the evidence.
I have taken it for the purpose of being laid before Pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>fessor
Owen, to whom, also, I shall send to-morrow, at the
request of a friend of his, eighteen or twenty of the little
fish. Three of them are large and very stout, measuring
about four inches. The rest are small. There were some&mdash;but
they are since dead&mdash;fully five inches long. They
are very lively.&mdash;Your obedient servant,</p>

</p>

<p>The specimens which were forwarded to Professor Owen
were exhibited in a tank at the Zoological Gardens in the
Regent's Park: they consisted of minnows (<i>Leuciscus
phoxinus</i>) and Smooth-tailed sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus
leiurus</i>.) A <i>savant</i> thus endeavoured to "enlighten" the
uninitiated on the matter:&mdash;"On reading the evidence
it appears to me most probably only a practical joke of
the mates of John Lewis, who seem to have thrown a
pailful of water with the fish in it over him, and he appears
to have returned them to the pool from which they
were originally taken. The fish forwarded are very unlike
those taken up in whirlwinds in tropical countries, and we
must make allowance for unintentional exaggerations of
quantity, &amp;c., in an account given a month after the event
had occurred."</p>

<p>This "appears to me" a beautiful example of critical
acumen. My readers will do well to look at it for a
moment; as they may thus learn how to sift the grain
of truth out of the bushel of chaff. <i>Reverent&egrave;r procedamus!</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The main (is it not the only?) objection to the honest
sawyer's statement is that "the fish are very unlike those
taken up in whirlwinds in tropical countries." That is,
that, seeing the phenomenon occurs in Great Britain, it
is most unfortunate that the fishes are British species.
Now, in India, when such things occur, it is always
<i>Indian</i> species that are taken up; <i>ergo</i>, it ought to be
Indian species <i>here</i>. But these are "very unlike" the
Indian fishes; <i>ergo</i>, it is manifestly a humbug.</p>

<p>Then, does it not strike one as palpably probable, when
once one's dull intellect has been "enlightened" by the
brilliant suggestion,&mdash;that the worthy sawyer who had
a pail of water soused upon him, thought it was a heavy
shower of rain? <i>Very</i> heavy, no doubt; indeed he says
it was "uncommon wet." To be sure, he thought there
were <i>two</i> showers, each lasting about two minutes, with
an interval of ten minutes between them; but this little
error might be easily made, for doubtless a bucket of
water poured on one's head might well be equivalent to
two showers of rain, or even ten, for that matter. To be
sure, moreover, there was a considerable quantity of
fish:&mdash;"The whole ground was covered with them: they
were jumping all about: they covered the ground in a
long strip of about eighty yards by twelve, <i>as we measured</i>
afterwards: the shed was covered with them, and
the shoots were quite full of them.... My mates and
I might have gathered bucketfuls of them: we did gather
about a bucketful." Yes, yes: but all were originally in
the pail of water thrown over you, John. How stupid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
you were, not to perceive <i>that</i>! How there was room for
any water at all in the pail, seeing there were so many
fish, you say you don't know; but that is your stupidity,
John! There <i>must</i> have been room for water, for it was
"uncommon wet;" and the water was in the pail, for the
Doctor says so. Uncommon fishy, too, I should think;
but let that pass. Where the mates collected the pail of
live fishes for their pleasant and profitable hoax, and how,
and when,&mdash;the sceptic might wonderingly ask; but a
hoax it was. <i>Ipse dixit.</i></p>

<p>However, the verdict did not obtain universal assent;
and an excellent and well-known naturalist, Mr Robert
Drave, residing in the vicinity, ventured modestly to indicate
a dissent. "I think actual fact will excuse the
otherwise apparently unbecoming assumption in me, of
opposing such high authority by a contrary opinion, for
from information <i>obtained from many sources, and very
careful and minute</i> inquiry, I am quite convinced that a
great number of fish did actually descend with rain <i>over
a considerable tract of country</i>. The specimens I obtained
<i>from three individuals</i>, resident some distance
from each other, were of two species, the common minnow
and the three-spined stickleback; the former most
abundant, and mostly very small, though some had attained
their full size."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>If now we look to other lands, we shall find that the
descent of fishes from the atmosphere, under conditions
little understood, is a phenomenon which rests on indubi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>table
evidence. Humboldt has published interesting
details of the ejection of fish in large quantities from
volcanoes in South America. On the night between the
19th and 20th of June, 1698, the summit of Carguairazo,
a volcano more than 19,000 feet in height, fell in, and all
the surrounding country for nearly thirty-two square miles
was covered with mud and fishes. A similar eruption of
fish from the volcano of Imbaburu was supposed to have
been the cause of a putrid fever which raged in the town
of Ibarra seven years before that period.</p>

<p>These facts are not inexplicable. Subterraneous lakes,
communicating with surface-waters, form in deep cavities
in the declivities, or at the base of a volcano. In certain
active stages of ignition, these internal cavities are burst
open, and their contents discharged through the crater.
Humboldt ascertained that the fishes in question belonged
to a curious and ill-favoured species of the <i>Silurid&aelig;</i>,&mdash;the
<i>Pimelodes Cyclopum</i>.</p>

<p>Showers of fishes, however, do occur, which cannot be
connected with volcanic agency. Dr Buist, in an interesting
paper published in the <i>Bombay Times</i> in 1856,
has collected a number of authentic examples of this
phenomenon. The author, after enumerating the cases
just cited, and others of similar character, in which fishes
were said to have been thrown out from volcanoes in
South America, and precipitated from clouds in various
parts of the world, adduces the following instances of
similar occurrences in India:&mdash;"In 1824," he says, "fishes
fell at Meerut, on the men of her Majesty's 14th Regi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>ment,
then out at drill, and were caught in numbers. In
July 1826, live fish were seen to fall on the grass at
Moradabad during a storm. They were the common
<i>Cyprinus</i>, so prevalent in our Indian waters. On the 19th
of February 1830, at noon, a heavy fall of fish occurred
at the Nokulhatty factory, in the Daccah Zillah; depositions
on the subject were obtained from nine different
parties. The fish were all dead; most of them were
large; some were fresh, others were rotten and mutilated.
They were seen at first in the sky, like a flock of birds,
descending rapidly to the ground; there was rain drizzling,
but no storm. On the 16th and 17th of May, 1833,
a fall of fish occurred in the Zillah of Futtehpoor, about
three miles north of the Jumna, after a violent storm of
wind and rain. The fish were from a pound and a-half
to three pounds in weight, and of the same species as
those found in the tanks in the neighbourhood. They
were all dead and dry. A fall of fish occurred at Allahabad,
during a storm in May 1835; they were of the
chowla species, and were found dead and dry after the
storm had passed over the district. On the 20th of September
1839 after a smart shower of rain, a quantity of
live fish, about three inches in length, and all of the same
kind, fell at the Sunderbunds, about twenty miles south
of Calcutta. On this occasion it was remarked that the
fish did not fall here and there irregularly over the ground,
but in a continuous straight line, not more than a span
in breadth. The vast multitudes of fish, with which the
low grounds round Bombay are covered, about a week or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
ten days after the first burst of the monsoon, appear to be
derived from the adjoining pools or rivulets, and not to
descend from the sky. They are not, as far as I know,
found in the higher parts of the island. I have never seen
them, though I have watched carefully, in casks collecting
water from the roofs of buildings, or heard of them on
the decks or awnings of vessels in the harbour, where they
must have appeared had they descended from the sky.
One of the most remarkable phenomena of this kind
occurred during a tremendous deluge of rain at Kattywar,
on the 25th of July 1850, when the ground around Rajkote
was found literally covered with fish; some of them
were found on the top of haystacks, where probably they
had been drifted by the storm. In the course of twenty-four
successive hours twenty-seven inches of rain fell,
thirty-five fell in twenty-six hours, seven inches in one
hour and a-half, being the heaviest fall on record. At
Poonah, on the 3d of August 1852, after a very heavy
fall of rain, multitudes of fish were caught on the ground
in the cantonments, full half a mile from the nearest
stream. If showers of fish are to be explained on the
assumption that they are carried up by squalls or violent
winds, from rivers or spaces of water not far away from,
where they fall, it would be nothing wonderful were they
seen to descend from the air during the furious squalls
which occasionally occur in June."</p>

<p>Sir E. Tennent adds the following examples:&mdash;"I had
an opportunity, on one occasion only, of witnessing the
phenomenon which gives rise to this popular belief. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
was driving in the cinnamon gardens near the fort of
Colombo, and saw a violent but partial shower descend
at no great distance before me. On coming to the spot,
I found a multitude of small silvery fish from one and a
half to two inches in length, leaping on the gravel of the
high road, numbers of which I collected and brought away
in my palankin. The spot was about half a mile from the
sea, and entirely unconnected with any watercourse or pool.</p>

<p>"Mr Whiting, who was many years resident at Trincomalee,
writes me that he 'had been often told by the
natives on that side of the island that it sometimes rained
fishes; and on one occasion (he adds) I was taken by them,
in 1849, to a field at the village of Karrancotta-tivo, near
Batticaloa, which was dry when I passed over it in the
morning, but had been covered in two hours by sudden
rain to the depth of three inches, in which there was then
a quantity of small fish. The water had no connexion
with any pond or stream whatsoever.' Mr Cripps, in
like manner, in speaking of Galle, says: 'I have seen in
the vicinity of the fort, fish taken from rain-water that
had accumulated in the hollow parts of the land that in
the hot season are perfectly dry and parched. The place
is accessible to no running stream or tank; and either
the fish, or the spawn from which they were produced,
must of necessity have fallen with the rain.'"<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Mr J. Prinsep, the eminent secretary to the Asiatic
Society of Bengal, found a fish in the pluviometer at
Calcutta, in 1838.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>It is a highly curious fact that the pools, reservoirs,
and tanks in India and Ceylon are well provided with
fish of various species, though the water twice every year
becomes perfectly evaporated, and the mud of the bottom
becomes converted into dust, or takes the condition of
baked clay, gaping with wide and deep clefts, in which
not the slightest sign of moisture can be detected. This
is the case with temporary hollows in the soil, which have
no connexion with running streams or permanent waters,
from which they might be supposed to receive a fresh
stock of fish.</p>

<p>Two modes of accounting for this strange phenomenon
have obtained currency. The one is that received by
those Europeans who are content with any solution of a
difficulty, without too closely testing it; viz., that the
fishes fall with the rains from the air. The actual occurrence
of such showers rests, as we have just seen, on good
evidence; but, admitting the fact, it must be a rare phenomenon,
whereas the presence of fish in the new-made
pools is universal. Again, if the rains brought them in
such abundance as to stock all the pools, an equal number
would fall on the dry ground, which is not pretended to
be the case. The other accepted solution is that which
has received the sanction of Mr Yarrell, who observes&mdash;"The
impregnated ova of the fish of one rainy season are
left unhatched in the mud through the dry season, and
from their low state of organisation <i>as ova</i>, the vitality is
preserved till the occurrence and contact of the rain and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the oxygen of the next wet season, when vivification takes
place from their joint influence."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>This may be fully allowed, yet it does not meet the
exigences of the case. Sir E. Tennent and others have
shewn that it is not young fishes just escaped from the
egg which appear in the new-formed pools, but full-grown
fishes, fit for the market; a fact well known to the
Singalese fishermen, who resort to the hollows as soon as
the monsoon has brought rain; and they invariably take
in these pools, which a day or two before were as dry as
dust, plenty of fishes fully grown, a foot or eighteen inches
long, or longer.</p>

<p>Neither of these hypotheses, then, will account for the
fact: and we must admit that the fishes of these regions
have the instinct to burrow down in the solid mud of the
bottom, at the approach of the dry season, and the power
of retaining life, doubtless in a torpid condition, until the
return of the periodic rains, as Theophrastus long ago
observed.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Lepidosiren</i>, a very remarkable genus of animals
from Africa and South America, affords a curious illustration
of this power. It is altogether a highly singular
creature, and has attracted a great deal of notice because
its organisation belongs to two types: it is, so to speak,
placed midway between the great classes of Reptiles and
Fishes, the characters which identify it with either being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>almost equally balanced. Professor Owen and other eminent
physiologists regard it as a fish, while Professor Bischoff,
with others equally learned, consider it an Amphibian
reptile.</p>

<p>It is the habits of this strange creature, however, which
induce me to notice it here. An inhabitant of rivers and
ponds, which are swollen by periodic rains, and subject
to entire or partial desiccation by long droughts, it is
liable to be left by the retreating waters, exposed to the
burning sun, under which it would presently die, but for
a special provision.</p>

<p>The animal has the instinct to bury itself in the mud
of the bottom, on the approach of the droughts, penetrating
to a depth of several feet. There it coils itself
into a ball, with the tail folded over the nose, but so as
to leave the nasal apertures uncovered; and, probably
by its wrigglings, it forms a cavity or chamber in the
clay, which becomes lined with a membranous slough
thrown off from its body. Meanwhile the water evaporates,
the mud dries, bakes, and cracks under the torrid
heat of the dry season, thus allowing air to penetrate
down to the retreat of the torpid mud-fish, in sufficient
quantity for its very sluggish respiration. Here it lies
inactive for five or six months, until the wet season again
sets in, and the returning floods cover the old beds, soften
the baked clay, revivify the imprisoned animal, and restore
it to liberty and aquatic locomotion.</p>

<p>To meet these strange conditions of life, the <i>Lepidosiren</i>
is furnished with a twofold apparatus for respira<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>tion;
the one aquatic, consisting of gills, ordinarily contained
in a branchial chamber, (but in one species, at
least, external,) suited for the separation of oxygen from
the water, and the other aerial, consisting of true lungs,
closely resembling those of serpents, though manifestly
only a modification of the well-known swim-bladder of
many fishes,&mdash;by means of which the animal breathes
atmospheric air, during its periodic captivity.</p>

<p>The same emergency is met by other species in another
way. It does not appear that the <i>Lepidosiren</i> has the
power of voluntarily forsaking the water, or of travelling
on land, notwithstanding its twofold respiration; but
some of the fishes of the tropics certainly resort to this
mode of evading the fatal contingency of being baked
out by the evaporating power of the periodical dry
season.</p>

<p>Theophrastus, the contemporary of Aristotle, mentions
fishes found in the Euphrates which in the dry seasons
leave the vacant channels and crawl over the ground in
search of water, moving along by fins and tail.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Pallegoix
gives three kinds of fish in Siam, which leave the tanks
and channels and travel through the grass;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and Sir
John Bowring states that in ascending the river Meinam
to Bangkok, he was amused with the sight of fish leaving
the stream, gliding over the wet banks, till they disappeared
among the trees of the jungle.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The <i>Hydragyr&aelig;</i>
of Carolina in like manner leave the drying pools, and
seek the nearest water in a straight line, though at a
considerable distance. And Sir R. Schomburgk tells us
that certain species of <i>Dora</i> in Guiana have the same
habit, and are occasionally met with in such numbers in
their terrestrial travels that the negroes fill baskets with
them.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p><p>These fishes, provincially called Hassars, project themselves
on their bony pectoral fins, aiding their advance
by the elastic spring of the tail exerted sidewise, proceeding
in this manner nearly as fast as a man can walk.
The strong scaly bands which envelop the body facilitate
the march, in the same way as the transverse plates (<i>scuta</i>)
on the belly of serpents, which take hold of the ground,
as the ribs perform the office of feet. The Indians know
that these fishes have the power of carrying a supply of
water in a reservoir, for the keeping of the gills in a moist
condition. If they fail in finding water, they are said to
burrow in the still soft mud, and pass the dry season in
torpidity like the <i>Lepidosiren</i>.</p>

<p>The common eel is well known to have this habit of
travelling with us; I well remember my surprise, when a
boy, at finding an eel in a grassy meadow one dewy summer
evening, at a considerable distance from water. Since
then I have seen a small species of <i>Antennarius</i>, running
quickly to and fro on the surface of the great beds of
floating sea-weed in the Gulf stream, progressing by means
of its pectorals and ventrals quite out of water, with the
utmost facility.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>The most celebrated example of this faculty, however,
is the climbing perch (<i>Anabas scandens</i>) of India. The
vagaries of this little fish have been recorded from the
earliest times, and numerous modern witnesses have borne
record to its powers. Mr E. Layard once encountered
several travelling along a hot dusty gravel-road in the
mid-day sun.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Daldorf, a Danish zoologist of reputation,
asserts that he has seen this species in the act of climbing
palm-trees, effecting its ascent by means of fins and tail,
with the aid of its spinous gill-covers. There is, however,
some doubt whether he was not under mistake in
this, though the fact of its crawling up the banks and
living out of water is abundantly known.</p>

<p>On the coasts of Ceylon, according to its accomplished
historian,&mdash;on the rocks which are washed by the surf,
there are multitudes of a curious little fish, (<i>Salarias
alticus</i>,) which possesses the faculty of darting along the
surface of the water, and running up the wet stones, with
the utmost ease and rapidity. By aid of its pectoral and
ventral fins and gill-cases, it moves across the damp sand,
ascends the roots of the mangroves, and climbs up the
smooth face of the rocks in search of flies; adhering so
securely as not to be detached by repeated assaults of the
waves. These little creatures are so nimble, that it is
almost impossible to lay hold of them, as they scramble
to the edge, and plunge into the sea on the slightest
attempt to molest them. They are from three to four
inches in length, and of a dark-brown colour, almost indistinguishable
from the rocks they frequent.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<p>In all these cases probably, the power of sustaining a
protracted privation of water depends on a peculiar structure
of the pharynx, which is divided by membranous
plates into cells which the fish can fill at pleasure with
water, and by ejecting small portions at a time can
moisten its gills, and thus preserve the filaments of these
organs in a fit condition to maintain the circulation and
oxygenation of the blood. These labyrinthal water-chambers
are particularly numerous and complicated in
the <i>Anabas</i> just mentioned. This, however, has no analogy
with the lung of the <i>Lepidosiren</i>.</p>

<h2>MERMAIDS.</h2>


<p>According to Berosus there came up from the Red Sea,
on the shore contiguous to Babylonia, a brute creature
named Oannes, which had the body of a fish, above whose
front parts rose the head of a man; it had two human
feet, which projected from each side of the tail; it had
also a human voice and human language. This strange
monster sojourned among the rude people during the day,
taking no food, but retiring to the sea again at night;
and continued for some time, teaching them the arts of
civilised life. Other ancient authors, as Polyhistor and
Apollodorus, allude to the same tradition; and we gather
that the portrait of the learned stranger (not painted <i>from
the life</i>, we may presume, considering the condition of the
people when he appeared, unless we may suppose it to
have been the effort of one of his pupils in the pictorial
art under his instruction) was preserved at Babylon to the
historic period.</p>

<p>In an elaborate sculpture of the later Assyrian period,
discovered by M. Botta at Khorsabad, a maritime expedition
is portrayed, and the sea around the ships is filled
with various marine animals, and among them the compound
mythic forms of winged bulls and bull-lions, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
which the Assyrians delighted, together with a figure
composed of the body and tail of a fish extended horizontally,
and the perpendicular trunk and foreparts of a man,
crowned with the sacred cap, possibly representing the
traditional Oannes.</p>

<p>The god Dagon of the Philistines, and the goddess
Atergatis of the Syrians were worshipped under the
same combination of the human and piscine forms, and
the Tritons of classical mythology perpetuated the idea.</p>

<p>It is curious that in almost all ages and in almost all
countries there should have prevailed a belief in the
actual living existence of creatures like this. Was the
mythological symbol the origin of the persuasion? Or
is there any marine animal uniting so much of the general
form of the fish with that of man as to have given the
conception of the idol? A naturalist of deserved eminence
has maintained, on purely scientific grounds, that
such an animal must exist,&mdash;that the laws of nature absolutely
require such a being; and though the amount of
force which his reasoning, possesses will be estimated
differently according as we reject or accept the hypothesis
of the circularity of the great plan of nature, we may as
well see what he has to say for a marine primate,&mdash;be he
man or ape, mermaid or mermonkey.</p>

<p>"There is yet," says Mr Swainson, "another primary
type necessary to complete the circle of the quadrumanous
animals, and it is that which we have elsewhere distinguished
as the natatorial; but of such an animal we have
only vague and indefinite accounts. It will be seen that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
throughout the whole class of quadrupeds, the aquatic
types are remarkably few, and in general scarce; and
that they contain fewer forms or examples than any other,
and are often, in the smaller groups, entirely wanting.
To account for this is altogether impossible; we can only
call attention to the fact, as exemplified in the aquatic
order of <i>Cetacea</i>, in that of the <i>Fer&aelig;</i>, in the <i>Pachydermata</i>,
in the circle of the <i>Glires</i>, and in all the remaining
natatorial types of the different circles of quadrupeds.
We do not implicitly believe in the existence of mermaids
as described and depicted by the old writers&mdash;with a
comb in the one hand and a mirror in the other; but it is
difficult to imagine that the numerous records of singular
marine animals, unlike any of those well known, have
their origin in fraud or gross ignorance. Many of these
narratives are given by eye-witnesses of the facts they
vouch for&mdash;men of honesty and probity, having no object
to gain by deception, and whose accounts have been confirmed
by other witnesses equally trustworthy. Can it
be supposed that the unfathomable depths of ocean are
without their <i>peculiar</i> inhabitants, whose habits and
economy rarely, if ever, bring them to the surface of the
watery element? As reasonably might a Swiss mountaineer
disbelieve in the existence of an ostrich, because it
cannot inhabit his Alpine precipices, as that we should
doubt that the rocks and caverns of the ocean are without
animals destined to live in such situations, and such
only. The natatorial type of the <i>Quadrumana</i>, however,
is most assuredly wanting. Whatever its precise con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>struction
may or might have been, it would represent and
correspond to the seals in the circle of the <i>Fer&aelig;</i>, or rapacious
quadrupeds; while a resemblance to the <i>Simiad&aelig;</i>,
or monkeys, must be considered an essential character of
any marine animal which is to connect and complete the
circular series of types in the <i>Quadrumana</i>."</p>

<p>Mr Swainson absolutely excludes Man from the zoological
circle, on grounds which few naturalists are disposed
to think sufficient; else we might suggest that man himself
is the natatorial type of the <i>Primates</i>. Taking this
author's own selection<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> of the characters which mark the
natatorial types of animals, for our guide, we find that the
largest size, the smallest fore-limbs, the most obtuse
muzzle, the most carnivorous appetite, and the most
natatory habits (for I do not know that the Apes, or the
Sapajous, or the Lemurs, or the Bats, ever take to the
water voluntarily, whereas savage Man is always a great
swimmer), belong to Man, and so, <i>Swainsonio ipso judice</i>,
constitute <i>him</i> the true aquatic primate. But if so, we
do not want a merman or mermonkey; nay, we should
not know where to insert him in the zoological circle if
we found him; he would be awkwardly <i>de trop</i>.</p>

<p>But yet nature <i>has</i> an awkward way of mocking at our
impossibilities; and it <i>may be</i> that green-haired maidens
with oary tails lurk in the ocean caves, and keep mirrors
and combs upon their rocky shelves. Certainly the belief
in them is very widely spread, and occasionally comes to
us from quarters where we should hardly have looked for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>it. A negro from Dongola assured Prince Puckler Muskau
that in the country of Sennaar there was no doubt
that Sirens (mermaids) still existed, for that he himself
had seen more than one.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In my boyhood I well recollect being highly excited by
the arrival in our town, at fair-time, of a "show," which
professed to exhibit a mermaid, whose portrait, on canvas
hung outside, was radiant in feminine loveliness and
piscine scaliness. I fondly expected to see the very counterpart
within, how disposed I did not venture to imagine,
but alive and fascinating, of course. Had I not seen her
picture? I joyfully paid my coppers, but oh! woful disappointment!
I dimly saw, within a dusty glass case, in a
dark corner, a shrivelled and blackened little thing which
might have been moulded in mud for aught I could see,
but which was labelled, "MERMAID!" So great was
my disgust, so bitter my feelings of shame and anger at
having been so grossly taken in, that I did not care to
observe what might have been noteworthy in it. I read
afterwards that it was a very ingenious cheat; the trunk
and head of a monkey had been grafted on to the body
and tail of a large salmon-like fish, and the junction had
been so cleverly effected, that only a very close examination
detected the artifice. It professed to have been
brought from China, but possibly was an importation even
thither, if Steinmetz is correct. According to this writer,
"A Japanese fisherman contrived to unite the upper half
of a monkey to the lower half of a fish, so neatly as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
defy ordinary inspection. He then gave out that he had
caught the creature alive in his net, but that it had died
shortly after being taken out of the water; and he derived
considerable pecuniary profit from his cunning in more
ways than one. The exhibition of the sea-monster to
Japanese curiosity paid well; but yet more productive
was the assertion that the half-human fish, having spoken
the few minutes it existed out of its native element, had
predicted a certain number of years of wonderful fertility,
and a fatal epidemic, the only remedy for which would be
possession of the marine prophet's likeness. The sale of
these pictured mermaids was immense. Either this composite
animal, or another, the offspring of the success of
the first, was sold at the Dutch factory, and transmitted
to Batavia, where it fell into the hands of a speculating
American, who brought it to Europe, and here, in the
years 1822-3, exhibited his purchase as a real mermaid
at every capital, to the admiration of the ignorant, the
perplexity of the learned, and the filling of his own purse.
Indeed, the mermaids exhibited in Europe and America,
to the great profit of the enterprising showmen, have all
been of Japanese manufacture."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>This, however, will not account for the frequent reports
of the living creatures having been seen, and unbelievers
have to form some other hypothesis. In the tropical seas
the cow-whales, uncouth marine <i>pachydermata</i>, have been
assumed to be the originals of these stories. Megasthenes
reported that the sea which washed Taprobane, the modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Ceylon, was inhabited by a creature having the appearance
of a woman; and &AElig;lian improves the account by
stating that there are whales having the form of satyrs.
'Tis true the Manatee and the Dugong are rather mer-swine
than mer-maids; but there is something in the
bluff round head which may remind a startled observer of
the human form divine. Sir Emerson Tennent considers
that this rude approach to the human outline, and the
attitude of the mother while suckling her young, pressing
it to her breast with one paw, while swimming with the
other, the head of both being held perpendicularly above
water, and then, when disturbed, suddenly diving and displaying
her broad fin-like tail,&mdash;these, together with her
habitual demonstrations of strong maternal affection, may
probably have been the original from which the pictures
of the mermaid were portrayed, and thus that earliest
invention of mythical physiology may be traced to the
Arab seamen and to the Greeks, who had watched the
movements of the Dugong in the Red Sea and Indian
Ocean.</p>

<p>The early Portuguese settlers in India had no doubt
that true mermen were found in those seas; and the
annalist of the exploits of the Jesuits narrates that seven
of these monsters, male and female, were captured at
Manaar in 1560, and carried to Goa, where they were dissected
by Demas Bosquez, physician to the Viceroy, and
"their internal structure found to be in all respects conformable
to the human." Making allowance for the very
limited acquaintance which the worthy physician was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
likely to have made with human anatomy by actual
autopsy, this statement goes for little:&mdash;the real resemblance,
assuming them to have been Dugongs, was about
the same as that presented by the hog, whose inwards are
popularly believed by our own country people to be in
very close accordance with those of "Christians."</p>

<p>Sir E. Tennent has embellished his book with a very
taking portrait of the mermaid on the Dugong hypothesis;
shewing two females, each holding a baby [is it right to
say <i>merbaby</i>?], emerging from the sea-wave; they do look,
to be sure, sufficiently human, but the well-known monogram
of our clever friend Wolf in the corner of the cut
suggests shrewd doubts that the portraits were not "<i>ad
viv</i>."</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, among the Scandinavian races that the
belief in the merman has reached its culminating point.
So many particulars are inculcated concerning the mode
and conditions of life of these submarine beings, that the
most intimate relations appear to have subsisted between
the terrestrial and the aquatic peoples. According to the
creed of the Norsemen, there exists, far beneath the
depths of the ocean, an atmosphere adapted to the breathing
organs of beings resembling in form the human race,
endowed with surpassing beauty, with limited supernatural
powers, but liable to suffering, and even to death.
Their dwelling is in a vast region, situate far below the
bottom of the sea, which forms a canopy over them, like
the sky over us, and there they inhabit houses constructed
of the pearly and coralline productions of the ocean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Having lungs not adapted to a watery medium, but
formed for breathing atmospheric air, it would be impossible
for them to pass through the volume of waters that
separates our world from theirs, if it were not that they
possess the power of entering the skin of some marine
animal, whose faculties they thus temporarily acquire, or
of changing their own form and structure so as to suit
the altered condition through which they are to travel.
The most ordinary shape they assume is, as everybody
knows, that of man (that is, their own proper form) from
the waist upward, but below that of a fish. Whether they
now breathe by gills or lungs, the anatomists, it seems,
have not yet determined; we must presume the former
alternative, since else it is not apparent what they have
gained by their piscine metamorphosis of tail; though
where the branchi&aelig; are situate we are a little at a loss to
imagine. These, however, are matters which doubtless
the scientific world will one day determine: it seems certain
that they do thus acquire an amphibious nature, so
as not only to exist submerged in the waters, but to land
on the shores of our sunny world, where they frequently
doff their fishy half, resume their proper human form, and
pass muster while they pursue their investigations here.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, but one of these resources can ever be
availed of by any individual mer-man or -maid, nor can any
"son or daughter of the ocean borrow more than one sea-dress
of this kind for his own particular use; therefore if
the garb should be mislaid on the shores he never can re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>turn
to his submarine country and friends. A Shetlander,
having once found an empty seal-skin on the shore, took
it home and kept it in his possession. Soon after, he met
the most lovely being who ever stepped on the earth,
wringing her hands with distress, and loudly lamenting,
that, having lost her sea-dress, she must remain for ever
on the earth. The Shetlander, having fallen in love at
first sight, said not a syllable about finding this precious
treasure, but made his proposals, and offered to take her
for better or for worse, as his future wife! The merlady,
though not, as we know, much a woman of the world,
very prudently accepted the offer! I never heard what
the settlements were, but they lived very happily for some
years, till one day, when the green-haired bride unexpectedly
discovered her long-lost seal-skin, and instantly
putting it on, she took a hasty farewell of everybody, and
ran towards the shore. Her husband flew out in pursuit
of her, but in vain! She sprang from point to point, and
from rock to rock, till at length, hastening into the ocean,
she disappeared for ever, leaving the worthy man, her
husband, perfectly planet-struck and inconsolable on the
shore!"<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Nor are there lacking in the rocky cliffs of our own
northern islands fit lodgings for these sea kings and
queens. The gifted pen of Sir Walter Scott has sketched
one of these from his own observation: "Imagination
can hardly conceive anything more beautiful than the extraordinary
grotto discovered not many years since upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the estate of Alexander MacAllister, Esq. of Strathaird [in
Skye]. The first entrance to this celebrated cave is rude
and unpromising: but the light of the torches with which
we were provided, was soon reflected from the roof, floor,
and walls, which seemed as if they were sheeted with
marble, partly smooth, partly rough with frostwork and
rustic ornaments, and partly seeming to be wrought into
statuary. The floor forms a steep and difficult ascent,
and might be fancifully compared to a sheet of water,
which, while it rushed whitening and foaming down a
declivity, had been suddenly arrested and consolidated by
the spell of an enchanter. Upon attaining the summit of
this ascent, the cave opens into a splendid gallery, adorned
with the most dazzling crystallizations, and finally descends
with rapidity to the brink of a pool, of the most limpid
water, about four or five yards broad. There opens beyond
this pool a portal arch, formed by two columns of
white spar, with beautiful chasing upon the sides, which
promises a continuation of the cave. One of our sailors
swam across, for there is no other mode of passing, and
informed us (as indeed we partly saw by the light he
carried) that the enchantment of MacAllister's cave terminates
with this portal, a little beyond which there was
only a rude cavern, speedily choked with stones and earth.
But the pool on the brink of which we stood, surrounded
by the most fanciful mouldings, in a substance resembling
white marble, and distinguished by the depth and purity
of its waters, might have been the bathing grotto of a
naiad. The groups of combined figures projecting or em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>bossed,
by which the pool is surrounded, are exquisitely
elegant and fanciful. A statuary might catch beautiful
hints from the singular and romantic disposition of those
stalactites. There is scarce a form or group on which
active fancy may not trace figures or grotesque ornaments,
which have been gradually moulded in this cavern by the
dropping of the calcareous water hardening into petrifactions.
Many of these fine groups have been injured
by the senseless rage for appropriation of recent tourists;
and the grotto has lost, (I am informed,) through the
smoke of torches, something of that vivid silver tint which
was originally one of its chief distinctions. But enough
of beauty remains to compensate for all that may be
lost."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>But these tales are the <i>nug&aelig; canor&aelig;</i> of the naturalist.
Once more,&mdash;Is there any substratum of truth underlying
these fancies? or must they be unhesitatingly dismissed
to the region of fable? Certainly, if there were not two
or three narratives which have an air of veracity and dependableness,
bearing out the belief to some slight extent,
I should not have noticed it here.</p>

<p>How simple and circumstantial is this story told by old
Hudson, the renowned navigator! a man whose narrative
is more than usually dry and destitute of everything like,
not only imagination, but even an imaginative aspect of
ordinary circumstances. On the 15th of June, when in
lat. 75&deg;, trying to force a passage to the pole near Nova
Zembla, he records the following incident: "This morn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>ing
one of our company looking overboard saw a mermaid;
and calling up some of the company to see her, one
more came up, and by that time she was come close to
the ship's side, looking earnestly on the men. A little
after, a sea came and overturned her. From the navel
upward, her back and breasts were like a woman's, as
they say that saw her; her body as big as one of us; her
skin very white; and long hair hanging down behind, of
colour black. In her going down they saw her tail, which
was like the tail of a porpoise, and speckled like a
mackerel. Their names that saw her were Thomas Hilles
and Robert Rayner."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Whatever explanation be attempted of this apparition,
the ordinary resource of seal or walrus will not avail here.
Seals and walruses must have been as familiar to these
Polar mariners as cows to a dairy-maid. Unless the whole
story was a concerted lie between the two men, reasonless
and objectless,&mdash;and the worthy old navigator doubtless
knew the character of his men,&mdash;they must have seen, in
the black-haired, white-skinned creature, some form of
being as yet unrecognised.</p>

<p>Steller, a zoologist of some repute, who examined the
natural history of the Siberian seas, reports having seen,
near Behring's Straits, a strange animal, which he calls a
Sea-ape. "It was about five feet long, with a head like
a dog's; the ears sharp and erect, and the eyes large; on
both lips it had a kind of beard; the form of the body
was thick and round, but tapering to the tail, which was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>bifurcated, with the upper lobe longest; the body was
covered with thick hair, grey on the back, and red on the
belly. Steller could not discover any feet or paws. It
was full of frolic, and sported in the manner of a monkey,
swimming sometimes on one side of the ship and sometimes
on the other, and looking at it with seeming surprise.
It would come so near the ship that it might be
touched with a pole; but if any one stirred, it would immediately
retire. It often raised one third of its body
above the water, and stood upright for a considerable
time; then suddenly darted under the ship, and appeared
in the same attitude on the other side; this it would
repeat for thirty times together. It would frequently
bring up a sea plant, not unlike a bottle-gourd, which it
would toss about and catch again in its mouth, playing
numberless fantastic tricks with it."</p>

<p>There is nothing in this description which would exclude
it from well-recognised zoological classification. It
is highly probable that it was one of the seal tribe, but
of a species, perhaps a genus, not yet identified. All
analogy would suggest that fore-paws must have been
present in an animal with a dog-like head, and clothed
with hair; but they were perhaps small,&mdash;smaller even
than in other <i>Phocad&aelig;</i>, and may have been so concealed
in the long hair, or held so closely pressed to the body,
as not to be visible. The only other difficulty is in the
posterior extremity. This is described by Steller in terms
that imply a true piscine tail, expanded in a direction
vertical to the plane of the body, and of that peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
form called <i>heterocercal</i>, which distinguishes the cartilaginous
families of Fishes, the Sharks and Rays. But
the animal was indubitably a Mammal; and therefore we
may almost with certainty assume that, if the body terminated
in a natatory expansion, it would be, as in the
whales, and manatees, a horizontal expansion, and not a
vertical one. But if the strange creature was indeed, as
I conclude, of the Phocine type, we have only to suppose
the tail, which is usually very small in this family, to have
been so greatly developed, as to exceed the united hind
feet, which may have been small, and the appearance,
seen momentarily, and in the wash of the waves, might
well seem that of a heterocercal tail.</p>

<p>Captain Weddell, well known for his geographical discoveries
in the extreme south of the globe, relates the
following story: "A boat's crew were employed on Hall's
Island, when one of the crew, left to take care of some produce,
saw an animal whose voice was even musical. The
sailor had lain down, and about ten o'clock he heard a
noise resembling human cries; and as daylight in these
latitudes never disappears at this season, he rose and looked
around; but, on seeing no person, returned to bed; presently
he heard the noise again; rose a second time, but
still saw nothing. Conceiving, however, the possibility
of a boat being upset, and that some of the crew might
be clinging to some detached rocks, he walked along the
beach a few steps, and heard the noise more distinctly,
but in a musical strain. Upon searching round he saw
an object lying on a rock a dozen yards from the shore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
at which he was somewhat frightened. The face and
shoulders appeared of human form, and of a reddish
colour; over the shoulders hung long green hair; the
tail resembled that of the seal, but the extremities of the
arms he could not see distinctly. The creature continued to
make a musical noise while he gazed about two minutes,
and on perceiving him it disappeared in an instant. Immediately
when the man saw his officer, he told this
wild tale, and to add weight to his testimony, (being a
Romanist,) he made a cross on the sand which he kissed,
as making oath to the truth of his statement. When I
saw him, he told the story in so clear and positive a
manner, making oath to its truth, that I concluded he
must really have seen the animal he described, or that it
must have been the effects of a disturbed imagination."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The <i>green</i> hair in this description is the most suspicious
element; it is so exactly that attributed to the poetical
mermaids, and so entirely without precedent in the whole
range of known zoology,&mdash;that, if taken literally, I fear it
would condemn the narrative. But among the Antarctic
seals, both golden yellow fur, and black fur, are found;
and if hairs of these two colours were about equally intermingled,
the result would be an olive-green, as we see in
some of the monkeys; and then some allowance must
doubtless be made for imagination, in one little accustomed
to precise observation, and "somewhat frightened"
withal. I should say, with little hesitation, that this
creature was of the seal family, only that the seaman's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>daily habits brought him into the most familiar contact
with various kinds of seals; and, unless the animal in
question had differed notably from such as he was
acquainted with, he would not have been so affected by
the phenomenon. In such stories, the sorts of creatures
familiar to the observation of the narrator, and the amount
of surprise produced in his mind by the stranger,&mdash;must
always be carefully estimated, as important elements in
the formation of our judgment.</p>

<p>To come nearer home, Pontoppidan records the appearance
of a merman, which was deposed to on oath by the
observers: "About a mile from the coast of Denmark,
near Landscrona, three sailors, observing something like a
dead body floating in the water, rowed towards it. When
they came within seven or eight fathoms, it still appeared
as at first, for it had not stirred; but at that instant it
sunk, and came up almost immediately in the same place.
Upon this, out of fear, they lay still, and then let the boat
float, that they might the better examine the monster,
which, by the help of the current, came nearer and nearer
to them. He turned his face and stared at them, which
gave them a good opportunity of examining him narrowly.
He stood in the same place for seven or eight minutes,
and was seen above the water breast high. At last they
grew apprehensive of some danger, and began to retire;
upon which the monster blew up his cheeks, and made a
kind of lowing noise, and then dived from their view. In
regard to his form, they declare in their affidavits, which
were regularly taken and recorded, that he appeared like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
an old man, strong-limbed, with broad shoulders, but his
arms they could not see. His head was small in proportion
to his body, and had short curled black hair, which
did not reach below his ears; his eyes lay deep in his
head, and he had a meagre face, with a black beard;
about the body downwards this merman was quite pointed
like a fish."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>But the most remarkable story that I know of in recent
times, is that adduced by Dr Robert Hamilton, in his
able History of the Whales and Seals, in the <i>Naturalist's
Library</i>, he himself vouching for its general truth, from
personal knowledge of some of the parties: "It was reported
that a fishing-boat, off the island of Yell, one
of the Shetland group, had captured a mermaid by its
getting entangled in the lines!! The statement is, that
the animal was about three feet long, the upper part
of the body resembling the human, with protuberant
mamm&aelig; like a woman; the face, the forehead, and neck,
were short and resembling those of a monkey; the arms,
which were small, were kept folded across the breast; the
fingers were distinct, not webbed; a few stiff long bristles
were on the top of the head, extending down to the shoulders,
and these it could erect and depress at pleasure,
something like a crest. The inferior part of the body
was like a fish. The skin was smooth, and of a grey
colour. It offered no resistance, nor attempted to bite,
but uttered a low plaintive sound. The crew, six in
number, took it within their boat, but superstition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>getting the better of curiosity, they carefully disentangled
it from the lines, and a hook which had accidentally
fastened in its body, and returned it to its
native element. It instantly dived, descending in a
perpendicular direction.</p>

<p>"After writing the above, (we are informed) the narrator
had an interview with the skipper of the boat and one of
the crew, from whom he learned the following additional
particulars. They had the animal for three hours within
the boat; the body was without scales or hair; was of a
silvery grey colour above, and white below, like the human
skin; no gills were observed; nor fins on the back or
belly. The tail was like that of the dog-fish: the mamm&aelig;
were about as large as those of a woman; the mouth
and lips were very distinct, and resembled the human.</p>

<p>"This communication was from Mr Edmonston, a well-known
and intelligent observer, to the distinguished Professor
of Natural History in the Edinburgh University,
and Mr E. adds a few reflections, which are so pertinent,
that we shall avail ourselves of them. That a very peculiar
animal has been taken, no one can doubt. It was
seen and handled by six men, on one occasion, and for
some time, not one of whom dreams of a doubt of its
being a mermaid. If it were supposed that their fears
magnified its supposed resemblance to the human form, it
must at all events be admitted that there was some ground
for exciting these fears. But no such fears were likely to
be entertained; for the mermaid is not an object of terror
to the fisherman; it is rather a welcome guest, and danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
is to be apprehended only from its experiencing bad treatment.
The usual resources of scepticism, that the seals
and other sea-animals, appearing under certain circumstances,
operating on an excited imagination, and so producing
ocular illusion, cannot avail here. It is quite impossible
that, under the circumstances, six Shetland fishermen
could commit such a mistake."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>There is, no doubt, much in this account which signally
distinguishes it from all other statements with which it
can be compared, except that of Hudson's sailors, with
which it well coincides. The protuberant mamm&aelig;, resembling
those of a woman; the human, or at least simian
face, forehead, and neck, and especially the mouth and
lips; the distinct unwebbed fingers; the erectile crest of
bristles; the nature of the surface,&mdash;without scales or
hair; the colour; and the tail,&mdash;like that of a fish;&mdash;are
all very remarkable points; and unless we conclude the
entire story to be a lie, a mere barefaced hoax,&mdash;must
necessarily indicate a creature of which scientific zoology
knows absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>It is observable that, here again, the tail is said to have
been piscine and heterocercal, "like that of the dog-fish:"
while the naked skin, and the colour&mdash;silvery grey above
and white below,&mdash;will well agree with the characteristics
common to the smaller <i>Squalid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>It is a pity that an account like this, avouched by six
witnesses, was not thoroughly sifted. I have no doubt
that, if a person tolerably conversant with zoology, and accustomed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to the habit of cross-examination, had examined
these six eye-witnesses <i>separately</i>, making full notes of
what each could remember to have observed, and had then
checked each deposition by all the others, a mass of testimony
would have been accumulated that would in an
instant have convinced any candid inquirer what measure
of truth lay in the story. Points in which the whole six,
or even three or four, agreed, might unhesitatingly have
been set down as correct: suggestive questions, (not, however,
suggesting the sort of answer,) as, "Had the creature
so and so, or so and so?" could not have received the
same reply from all the deponents, without being worthy
of credence: even the points on which they would have
differed might themselves have been instructive to an
intelligent inquirer. I do not know that any such precautionary
measures were resorted to in this case, and the
tale must remain as we get it; but I make these observations
for the purpose of suggesting, in the event of any
similar occurrence, the advantage of <i>separate</i> examination
in getting at the truth. On a review of the whole evidence,
I do not judge that this single story is a sufficient
foundation for believing in the existence of mermaids;
but, taken into combination with other statements, it induces
a strong suspicion that the northern seas may hold
forms of life as yet uncatalogued by science.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.</h2>

<h2>THE SELF-IMMURED.</h2>


<p>Turning from reputed beings of which the very existence
is the subject of doubt, let us consider one or two
well-known and homely creatures, about which a certain
degree of romantic interest hovers, because conditions of
life are attributed to them by popular faith, which the
general verdict of science denies.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable examples in this category
of <i>dubitanda</i>, is the oft-repeated case of Toads and similar
animals found inclosed within the solid wood of living
trees, or even within blocks of stone, with no discernible
communication with the external air, or at least no aperture
by which they could have entered their prison, yet, in
every instance, alive. That insuperable difficulties stand
<i>a priori</i> in the way of our believing in such conditions,
no one familiar with animal physiology can deny; for, as
Mr Bell observes, to believe that a Toad inclosed within
a mass of clay, or other similar substance, shall exist
wholly without air or food, for hundreds of years, and at
length be liberated alive and capable of crawling, on the
breaking up of the matrix,&mdash;now become a solid rock,&mdash;is
certainly a demand upon our credulity which few will be
ready to answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, after all, it is a question that must not be decided
<i>a priori</i>: it must rest upon evidence. It may be that
here, too, fact is stranger than fiction; and we must not
shut our eyes and ears to concurrent credible testimony,
if it happen to bear witness to facts which we cannot
account for. Truth will certainly be upon us, even
though, ostrich-like, we thrust our head into a bush, and
maintain that we cannot see it.</p>

<p>The learned historian of British Reptiles speaks with
his characteristic candour upon the point. He admits
that the many concurrent assertions of credible persons,
who declare themselves to have been witnesses of the
emancipation of imprisoned Toads, forbid us hastily to
refuse our assent, or at least to deny the possibility of
such a circumstance; while he demands better and more
cautious evidence to authorise our implicit faith in these
asserted facts.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary mode of accounting for the phenomena,
supposing them to be narrated in good faith, is that the
animal "fell into the hollow where the men were at work,
and was taken up by them in ignorance of the mode in
which it had come there," or that "it may have hidden
in the hollow of a tree during the autumn and winter,
and on the return of spring found itself so far inclosed
within its hiding-place as to be unable to escape." This
latter suggestion would be more worthy of attention were
the winter season the period in which, in our climate,
periodical additions are made to the living wood, so as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>narrow the entrance, or in which augmentations of bulk
occurred to Toads, so as to prevent them from getting out
where they got in;&mdash;but unfortunately the reverse of
both suppositions is true. As to the former suggestion,
while it may possibly serve to dismiss a few of the published
statements, there are others which it would be
absurd to explain thereby.</p>

<p>True to its principles of never shutting the door to the
investigation of any natural history subject, the <i>Zoologist</i>
has, during the eighteen years of its existence, been a
medium for collecting and preserving facts bearing on
this question. The pages of this periodical form an
invaluable storehouse to the philosophic naturalist, who
wishes to pursue his science undeterred by the ridicule of
sciolism or the frown of authority. Let us search its
treasures, then, expecting to find stories of diverse grades
of credibility, of which the editor wisely leaves his readers
to judge for themselves.</p>

<p>In May 1844, the Rev. J. Pemberton Bartlett of Kingston,
in Kent, an experienced naturalist, mentions the
following fact as having just come under his own notice:&mdash;"Only
a few weeks since, in cutting down a fir-tree
here, the workman discovered, completely imbedded in the
centre, a Toad, which had doubtless been there some
years, as the tree had completely grown over it; it must
have been kept alive by absorbing the moisture of the
tree. It was not in a completely torpid state, and after
being exposed to the air a few hours, it crawled in true
toad-like style. The age of the tree in which it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
found was, as far as I could judge from the number of
circles, about twenty-five years."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>In reply to an inquiry whether he himself saw the Toad,
and counted the timber-rings, Mr Bartlett favours me
with the following note:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">
"<span class="smcap">Exbury Parsonage, near Southampton</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 6em;"><i>February 22, 1861</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash; ... <i>I</i> quite believe that Toads <i>do</i> live
in stone, but I have found it very difficult to get the facts
from eye-witnesses. The imbedded Toad in the fir-tree,
mentioned by me in the <i>Zoologist</i>, I saw, and, as stated
there, I counted the rings of the tree. I believe it to
have been the common Toad; but it looked rather more
flabby, and not quite so round in its proportions, as toads
generally do; in fact, instead of being 'puffed up' as
they commonly are, it was considerably <i>down in the
mouth</i>, from its close imprisonment! The cavity in
which it was fixed appeared to have been originally a
crack or fissure in the side of the tree; whether caused by
decay, or made by a nuthatch or some other bird, I cannot
say. The wound appeared to have healed, as the bark
had apparently closed over it. The question now arises,
Was the Toad <i>young</i> when it got into the hollow? and did
it grow after it became a prisoner? Or had it come to
years of discretion, when it took that unfortunate step, or
rather crawl, into the cavity where it was so long to be imprisoned?
And <i>why did</i> it remain there so quietly, while
the bark gradually grew over its prison-house? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
answer that I should give to the first of these questions
would be, that probably it had arrived at a state of <i>toadhood</i>
when it took refuge in the tree, and <i>did not</i> grow
afterwards. My theory why it remained ensconced there
so quietly is this, that probably it might have been accustomed
for some time to take refuge by day in this hole,
from whence it would set out on its nocturnal rambles,
and probably 'not go home till morning;' that on some
occasion, 'when daylight did appear,' it returned to its
accustomed haunt, and there squatted, winking and puffing,
after its night's exploits, as toads are wont to do;
that, on that luckless day, some felled tree or trees were
laid up against the fir-tree that contained its abode, and
that the tree or trees remained there till the bark closed
so as to prevent its escape. What makes this idea the
more probable is that the place where the fir-tree grew
had, for probably years, been used as a place to store
felled timber, as it was used for that purpose at the time
I saw the Toad.</p>

<p>"After the discovery of this Toad in the fir-tree, I tried
several experiments on Toads, by burying them in closely-sealed
flower-pots, at a depth of nearly three feet. I much
regret that I cannot find my notes on the subject; but I
remember perfectly the main facts of one. The Toad was
placed in a flower-pot, with another turned over it, and
well cemented together&mdash;the two holes in both pots being
also closely cemented up. It was buried between two and
three feet deep in the garden. At the end of three months
I took it up, and weighed the Toad, and found it had lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
a very little in weight. This I did again at the end of
three months more; it was then quite lively, and had lost
again but little in weight. I replaced it as before, and
on taking it up the third time, I found the pots had, probably
the cement not having been dry when buried,
slipped on one side, and the moisture had got in, and consequently
the poor Toad was dead, as well as buried!
Now, surely if a Toad could live <i>six months</i> hermetically
<i>sealed</i> in a flower-pot, without air or food&mdash;why not a
much longer time?...&mdash;Believe me, yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">
"<span class="smcap">J. Pemberton Bartlett</span>."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Rev. W. J. Bree of Allesley, also an excellent
zoologist, alluding to some queries by Mr E. Newman,
communicated the following facts:&mdash;"I quite agree with
you that the statements about Toads found in solid stone
are mostly very unsatisfactory. One instance of the kind
I have seen, as briefly stated, <i>Mag. Nat. Hist.</i>, ix. 316.
The Toad appeared to me neither more nor less than our
common species, although I certainly did not examine it
scientifically. The stone was the new red sandstone of
geologists; and was brought up, as I was told, some yards
from below the surface. I understood the Toad, and the
two portions of stone in which it was found inclosed,
were deposited in some medical museum at Birmingham.
The animal would not have been discovered but for an
accident: the workmen were carting the stone away, and
the block containing the Toad happened to be placed on
the top of a great load, and accidentally fell from the cart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to the ground, and, breaking by the fall, brought to light
the incarcerated reptile, which, I conclude, was somewhat
injured by the fall, as there was a fresh wound on one
side of the head, and it appeared to be blind of one eye.
The Toad died, I was informed, the second day after it
was discovered, partly, in all probability, in consequence
of the injury. When I say the block of stone was <i>solid</i>,
this statement requires some qualification: the two parts
of the stone fitted together exactly, and quite close, except
where the cavity was in which the Toad lay; but from
this cavity there was evidently a flaw on one side towards
the extremity, and a discolouring of the substance of the
sandstone, so that although the two portions fitted together,
they might not have been (on one side of the
cavity) very firmly united. This circumstance, perhaps,
may detract from the value of the example; nevertheless,
it is unaccountable how the animal could have got into
the position in which it was found: it is not conceivable,
I think, that it should have been there ever since the first
formation of the rock, and there certainly appeared to be
no means by which it could have entered the rock in its
present state, even admitting (what we know to be the
fact) that Toads have the power of getting in and out of
a very small orifice."</p>

<p>The author of the next account, signed "E. Peacock,"
is unknown to me; and it does not appear whether he
speaks from personal observation or not. He says, "A
few days ago, two labourers, employed at a stone quarry
at Frodingham, near Brigg, Lincolnshire, found, at a depth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of five feet below the surface of the ground, and between
two blocks of stone (lias), a living Toad: the interstice
between the stones was filled with yellow clay, and there
did not appear the least possible aperture by which anything
could have passed."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Even from remote India we have reports of the same
phenomenon. A correspondent from Serampore sends
the <i>Zoologist</i> the following:&mdash;"Last Wednesday, Feb. 7,
1849, on severing the branch of a tree, apparently of
the tamarind species, I found a Toad in the centre of the
wood, entirely excluded from light and air. The appearance
of the animal was rather extraordinary. The body
seemed full of air, and the skin soft and puffy, and of a
light yellowish colour, with the exception of the extremities
of the feet, which were hard and dark. The creature
when exposed to the air seemed rather uncomfortable, and
drew in its head just like a turtle when alarmed. It was
thrown into a tank, when the water around, to the space
of about a foot on either side, became perfectly white,
like milk. It jumped out of the water immediately,
apparently not liking the coldness. I did not have opportunity
of observing it further, which I regret, as the
animal got concealed in the long grass on the side of the
tank, and was thus lost. The general supposition as to the
mode by which animals get inclosed within trees, is their
taking shelter in the cavity of a tree when very young, and
the growth of the tree filling up the cavity, and thus imprisoning
the animal. But this supposition, if true in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>present case, makes the circumstance now related the more
extraordinary. The tree is an old one, upwards of fifty feet
high, and having a trunk more than three feet in diameter;
and the height from the ground at which the Toad was
found was about twelve feet. We must suppose the Toad
to have got into the tree when within a foot from the
ground: how many years old then must the animal be?"</p>

<p>The mention of the whitening of the water in which
the Toad was immersed is to my mind a strong corroboration
of the veracity of the preceding narrative. It is not
a circumstance at all likely to occur to a mere inventor,
as it does not in the least bear on the question of incarceration,
and there is no attempt to explain it. I have
occasionally seen fluids rendered partially opaque by the
outflow of a milky secretion from animals immersed in
them, as in the case of the curious <i>Peripatus</i> of Jamaica,
which, when put alive into spirits, discharges a considerable
quantity of white fluid, which diffuses in the alcohol.
The Toad was probably distinct from our common English
species, but we know that the latter secretes a yellow
acrid fluid in some abundance in the follicles of its skin,
and this might be poured out under the excitement of
alarm or anger.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1851, the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences
was interested (according to the public papers) with this
question. In digging a well at Blois, in June of that
year, "some workmen drew up from about a yard beneath
the surface a large flint, weighing about fourteen pounds,
and on striking it a blow with a pickaxe, it split in two,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and discovered, snugly ensconced in the very centre, a
large Toad. The Toad seemed for a moment greatly
astonished, but jumped out, and rather rapidly crawled
away. He was seized and replaced in the hole, when he
settled himself down very quietly. The stone and Toad,
just as they were, were sent to the Society of Sciences at
Blois, and became immediately the subject of curious
attention. First of all, the flint, fitted together, with the
Toad in the hole, was placed in a cellar, and imbedded in
moss. There it was left for some time. It is not known
if the Toad ate, but it is certain that he made no discharge
of any kind. It was found that if the top of the stone
were cautiously removed in a dark place he did not stir,
but that if the removal were effected in the light, he immediately
got out and ran away. If he were placed on
the edge of the flint, he would crawl into his hole, and fix
himself comfortably in. He gathered his legs beneath
his body; and it was observed that he took especial care
of one of his feet, which had been slightly hurt in one
of his removals. The hole is not one bit larger than the
body, except a little where the back is. There is a sort
of ledge on which his mouth reposes, and the bones of the
jaws are slightly indented, as if from long resting on a
hard substance. Not the slightest appearance of any
communication whatsoever between the centre and the
outside of the stone can be discovered, so that there is no
reason to suppose that he could have drawn any nourishment
from the outside. The committee, consisting of
three eminent naturalists, one of whom has made Toads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
his peculiar study for years, made no secret of their belief
that the Toad had been in that stone for hundreds, perhaps
thousands of years; but how he could have lived
without air, or food, or water, or movement, they made
no attempt to explain. They accordingly contented themselves
with proposing that the present should be considered
another authentic case, to be added to the few hundreds
already existing, of Toads being found alive imbedded in
stone, leaving it to some future savant to explain what
now appears the wonderful miracle by which Nature keeps
them alive so long in such places. But the distinguished
M. Majendie suggested that it was just possible that an
attempt was being made to hoax the Academy, by making
it believe that the Toad had been found in the hole,
whereas it might only have been put in by the mischievous
workmen after the stone was broken. Terrified at the
idea of becoming the laughing-stock of the public, the
Academy declined to take any formal resolution about
the Toad, but thanked the committee for its very interesting
communication; and so the subject dropped."</p>

<p>This statement does not, to be sure, bear about it that
character of precision which should mark the report of
a scientific body, nor is it verified by authority; but
the terror ascribed to L'Acad&eacute;mie at the idea of being
hoaxed, and the instant quashing of the inquiry, are so
true to nature, so accurately characteristic of our august
associations of savans, that I cannot help believing the
story.</p>

<p>Here is another, which has the air of a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
account, though I have no knowledge of the writer, nor
does he himself seem to pretend to personal autopsy of
the discovery.</p>

<p>On Monday last, September 20, while some workmen
were engaged in getting iron ore at a place called Paswick,
in the north of this county, [Derby,] they came
upon a solid lump of ore, which, being heavier than two
men could lift, they set to work to break with their picks,
when, to their surprise, in a cavity near the centre of the
stone, they found a Toad alive. The cavity was much
larger than the Toad, being nearly six inches in diameter,
and was lined with crystals of what I suppose to be carbonate
of lime. The stone was about four yards from
the surface of the ground; it is now in the possession of
Mr Haywood of Derby, by whose men it was found; but
unfortunately the Toad was not preserved after its death,
which took place almost immediately on its exposure to
the atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p><i>Audi alteram partem.</i> Mr Plant of the Salford Museum
tells us, both in sorrow and in anger, a story,
doubtless more amusing to us who read it than to him, of
his adventures among the toad-finders. When geologising
in the neighbourhood of Chesterfield, a quarryman,
whom he had invited to share a bottle of porter, informed
him in confidence that Toads inclosed in stone were plentiful
thereabout. "He said he had often found them,
and that he knew a stone before it was broken that would
contain a Toad; giving me long and circumstantial ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>counts
of the whole phenomenon: and, to convince me of
the truth of his statement, he took me to the quarry (a
carboniferous sandstone) that I might see the stones out
of which he said the Toads had been released. I examined
the stones and the whole quarry very attentively,
and listened to the emphatic testimony of other miners
present. After complying in an agreeable manner to
their remark that the day was warm, and the water of the
quarry not much in favour, I made a simple proposal of
this nature:&mdash;I promised to pay to any one of them the
sum of twenty shillings for the next stone in which they
found a Frog or Toad when the stone was broken in two.
They should catch the Frog if he bolted out of the hole,
replace him, and fit the stones together again, afterwards
despatching it to me in that condition. I further promised
to pay the sum of forty shillings to any one of
them who should procure me a stone, unbroken, in which
he considered a Toad or Frog was imprisoned, if, on breaking
it myself, such turned out to be the case. These
conditions were to remain in force for twelve months;
and as the means of conveyance to my address, which I
gave them, would occasion little or no trouble, the offer
was readily accepted by the miners; who also, to express
their confidence in soon being able to supply the order,
proposed that it would be all safe if I advanced a little
cash on account; which however I resolutely declined
doing. And now what will the credulous believers in
these 'Toads in stone' who read the <i>Zoologist</i> say, when
they learn that I visited the quarry twice during the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>twelve months, in order to fetch the Toads which never
came by rail? I always found the men there blasting
tons of new rock, splitting stones for every building purpose,
yet dry-throated and sullen; for, alas! most unaccountably
during that long twelve months they found
plenty of holes&mdash;not Toad holes&mdash;in the sandstone, but
the reptiles had been banished as effectually as ever they
were from the Emerald Isle."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<span class="caption">TOAD IN A HOLE.</span>
</div>

<p>This was disheartening, certainly: and we do not wonder
that Mr Plant became "a total disbeliever in these
'simple tales.'" Still, it is just possible, that immured
Toads may exist, though Mikey of the Chesterfield quarry,
in hope of the advance, did brag a little too confidently of
the commonness of the occurrence. That, within one
twelvemonth, within the limits of one quarry, no such
Toad turned up, even under the stimulus of the proffered
forty shillings, can scarcely be admitted to be absolutely
conclusive proof of the negative, at least not to us who
were not placed in the painful position of <i>gullees</i>. Mr
Arthur Hussey of Rottingdean justly remarks, when presenting
some evidence <i>per contra</i>, that we should not
think the innocence of a culprit was established by his
asserting, when sundry witnesses affirmed they saw him
commit the offence he was accused of,&mdash;that he could
produce ten times the number who would swear they <i>did
not</i> see him.</p>

<p>"During the summer of 1846," writes Mr Hussey, "in
the formation of a railroad, about half a mile from Ponte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>fract,
in Yorkshire, the works were carried a 'depth of four
feet through a rock betwixt lime and sandstone, about
the junction of the two formations:' the rock being so
firm as to require blasting. 'It is entirely free from beds
of any kind, or what the workmen term "backs," running
up it,' but therein are 'an infinite number of small
nodules of a harder quality, entirely crystallised in the
interior.' After blasting, the labourers were much surprised
to find among the fragments several of these
nodules, each one containing a Frog, as many as seven
having been counted after one 'shot.'</p>

<p>"These were not casually seen when exposed, and then
disregarded, but were examined in their stone prisons
through very minute holes, some even preserved in that
state for a long period. For example, the relator states
of one specimen, 'I kept this Toad in a cellar for about
five months, during which time it ate nothing, and was
without light, the hole in the stone being covered with a
piece of clay, and the whole kept moist and cool with
water.' Of another he says, 'The Frog lived only about
a week, as I kept it in a place which I think was too
warm for it, and also not sufficiently dark and quiet.
When the Frogs were disturbed by the shots, their first
desire seemed to be to get under shelter of some stone, or
into their old holes again, shewing thereby that sight was
not wanting, and bodily activity was perfect as far as
could be seen. One thing struck me as singular with
regard to the Frog I kept&mdash;its fresh, plump, and healthy
appearance, its skin being soft and transparent. One day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
when I was holding my finger over the hole in the stone,
it pushed its head between my finger and the sides of the
hole, and drew its whole body after it on to the table,
where it appeared more like a skeleton than any living
animal I have ever seen, but by degrees it extended itself
to its former dimensions.'</p>

<p>"Of the above curious occurrence my only knowledge is
derived from the account written to a distant friend, of
which the substance has now been extracted. The writer
is an utter stranger, but he was officially employed in the
operations which resulted in the discoveries; and my
information leads me to believe his report deserving of
confidence, for which reason I have not hesitated to offer
this abstract for publication in the <i>Zoologist</i>."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Alfred Charles Smith, an excellent and genial
naturalist, favours us with another case, introducing it
incidentally in illustration of the general habit he is
denouncing of wantonly destroying animal life:&mdash;"As an
instance of this thoughtless cruelty, I must give an
account that has just come to my notice. Some labourers
were pulling down an old wall, in the thickness of which
they found one of those phenomena&mdash;so frequently heard
of and so unsatisfactorily accounted for&mdash;a Toad completely
imbedded in stone and mortar. 'There was no
doubt,' said the labourer who described it, 'that he had
been there for a great number of years, for there was no
hole or chink by which he could have entered or left the
place of his long sojourn.' 'Well,' said the listener to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>account, 'but are you sure that the Toad was alive when
you found it?' 'No doubt of that, sir,' said the man, 'for
he crawled out of his round hole and was moving away,
when I knocked him on the head with my pickaxe.'</p>

<p>"So here was this poor harmless creature, whose long
incarceration in his gloomy dungeon might have excited
compassion in his favour, suddenly released from his
prison, only to be slain by his liberator!"<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The next is from the <i>Caledonian Mercury</i>. Newspaper
zoology is proverbially untrustworthy, and the editor of
the <i>Zoologist</i>, who reprints the paragraph, kindly adds a
caveat for the benefit of his readers,&mdash;"<i>Nimium ne crede
Mercurio!</i>" But, nevertheless, let us look at it: alone
it would stand for little, but, remember, in such questions
as this the evidence is cumulative. "There is at present
to be seen at Messrs Sanderson and Sons, George Street,
Edinburgh, an extraordinary specimen of natural history&mdash;a
Frog which had been discovered alive in freestone
rock. A few months ago, while some colliers in the
employ of Mr James Nasmyth (lessee of Dundonald
Colliery, in Fife, the property of R. B. Wardlaw Ramsay,
Esq. of Whitehill), were engaged in taking out the pavement
of the seam coal, which was freestone, they discovered
a cavity in which a Frog was lying. On touching
it the Frog jumped about for some time, and a bucket of
water being procured, it was put into it, and taken to the
surface. On reaching it, the animal was found to be dead.
It was at the depth of forty-five fathoms, or ninety yards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>from the surface, in a perpendicular line of strata, consisting
of alternate layers of coal and freestone, with
ironstone, and about four hundred yards from the outcrop
surface. The Frog seems to have much of the same
character as the present species. It is very attenuated,
which cannot be wondered at, considering its domicile for
so many ages, its original existence being of course considered
contemporaneous with the formation of the freestone
rock in which it was contained."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Now, again, we get the statement of a careful working
naturalist, Mr Thomas Clark of Halesleigh. He cannot,
indeed, give personal authority for what he records; but
the confidence of such a man in his informant is an element
not without its value. "March 25, 1859. In the
early part of this month, two live Toads were dug out
from the bottom of a bed of stiff brick clay, in the neighbourhood
of Bridgewater, at the depth of fourteen feet
from the surface of the ground; a third was killed by the
spade before they were observed. This bed of clay rests
on peat, and the Toads were found at the junction of the
two beds, in a small domed cavity, about the size of the
crown of a man's hat. On being exposed to the air, they
uttered a squeaking cry, resembling that of a rat, but in
about a minute they seemed reconciled to their new destiny,
and moved freely about. They were kept in a jar
for a few days, and then placed at liberty in a garden,
where I suppose they are still living. The living ones
were about two inches in length, but narrow in propor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>tion,
and of a rather lighter colour than Toads usually are;
the one which was killed was very much larger. The
clay under which they were buried had been gradually
dug out from the surface since about the beginning of
the year, but the last five feet of depth was not dug till
the day on which they were discovered. After about two
feet of the surface, the clay is very close and adhesive, and
far too moist to admit of cracks being formed in it, even
in the driest summers."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>To this communication inserted in the <i>Zoologist</i>, Mr
Newman added a note asking the name of any scientific
man who was present at the exhumation. Mr Clark replies:&mdash;"I
am unable to give such a name, further than
as the intelligent foreman of the brickyard, Thomas Duddridge,
(who witnessed the exhumation by one of the
labourers of the yard,) may be entitled to the appellation;
but no one, however high his scientific attainments, could
be more careful than he was to give me correct information,
or more exact in his statements; and if, after minute
inquiry, I had not been fully satisfied of the correctness
of his account, I should not have sought to occupy the
pages of the <i>Zoologist</i> with its recital. On shewing him
the notice in the <i>Zoologist</i>, he said it was impossible for
anything to be more correct; and he added, that the little
cavity which the Toads occupied was quite smooth in
every part, apparently by their long-continued movements,&mdash;as
smooth, to use his own illustration, as the
inside of a China bowl."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>Numerous experiments have been made with a view to
test the possibility of these reputed facts. If Toads do so
commonly become voluntarily or accidentally immured,
and remain without light, food, or even air, for many
years, and yet survive, let us put some Toads into similar
circumstances, keep them shut up, and, after the lapse of
a sufficient interval, examine them, and see whether they
are alive or dead. "<i>Experimentum faciemus in corpore
vili</i>," as the village doctor said to his assistant over the
sick traveller.</p>

<p><i>Probatum est!</i> Besides the case mentioned in Mr Bartlett's
letter (<i>ante</i>, p. 149), the late Dr Buckland, in November
1825, instituted a series of careful experiments, which
are thus narrated by himself:&mdash;"In one large block of
coarse oolitic limestone, twelve circular cells were prepared,
each about one foot deep and five inches in diameter, and
having a groove or shoulder at its upper margin fitted to
receive a circular plate of glass, and a circular slate to
protect the glass: the margin of this double cover was
closed round and rendered impenetrable to air and water
by a luting of soft clay. Twelve smaller cells, each six
inches deep and five inches in diameter, were made in
another block of compact siliceous sandstone, viz., the
Pennant Grit of the coal formation near Bristol; these
cells also were covered with similar plates of glass and
slate, cemented at the edge by clay. The object of the
glass covers was to allow the animals to be inspected,
without disturbing the clay so as to admit external air or
insects into the cell. The limestone is so porous that it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
easily permeable by water, and probably also by air; the
sandstone is very compact.</p>

<p>"On the 26th of November 1825, one live Toad was
placed in each of the above-mentioned twenty-four cells,
and the double cover of glass and slate placed over each
of them, and cemented down by the luting of clay. The
weight of each Toad in grains was ascertained and noted
by Dr Daubeny and Mr Dillwyn at the time of their
being placed in the cells; that of the smallest was 115
grains, and of the largest 1185 grains. The large and
small animals were distributed in equal proportion between
the limestone and sandstone cells.</p>

<p>"These blocks of stone were buried together in my
garden beneath three feet of earth, and remained unopened
until the 10th of December 1826, on which day
they were examined. Every Toad in the smaller cells of
the compact sandstone was dead, and the bodies of most
of them so much decayed that they must have been dead
some months. The greater number of those in the larger
cells of porous limestone were alive. No. 1, whose weight
when immured was 924 grains, now weighed only 698
grains. No. 5, whose weight when immured was 1185
grains, now weighed 1265 grains. The glass cover over
this cell was slightly cracked, so that minute insects might
have entered: none, however, were discovered in this cell;
but in another cell whose glass was broken, and the
animal within it dead, there was a large assemblage of
minute insects; and a similar assemblage also on the outside
of the glass of a third cell. In cell No. 9, a Toad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
which when put in weighed 988 grains, had increased to
1116 grains, and the glass cover over it was entire; but
as the luting of the cell within which this Toad had increased
in weight was not particularly examined, it is
probable there was some aperture in it by which small
insects found admission. No. 11 had decreased from 936
grains to 652 grains.</p>

<p>"When they were first examined in December 1826,
not only were all the small Toads dead, but the larger ones
appeared much emaciated, with the two exceptions above
mentioned; we have already stated that these probably
owed their increased weight to the insects which had
found access to the cells, and become their food.</p>

<p>"The death of every individual of every size in the
smaller cells of compact sandstone, appears to have resulted
from a deficiency in the supply of air, in consequence
of the smallness of the cells, and the impermeable
nature of the stone; the larger volume of air originally
inclosed in the cells of the limestone, and the porous
nature of the stone itself, (permeable as it is slowly by
water, and probably by air,) seem to have favoured the
duration of life to the animals inclosed in them without
food.</p>

<p>"It should be noticed that there is a defect in these
experiments, arising from the treatment of the twenty-four
Toads before they were inclosed in the blocks of
stone. They were shut up and buried on the 26th of
November, but the greater number of them had been
caught more than two months before that time, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
been imprisoned all together in a cucumber frame placed
on common garden earth, where the supply of food to so
many individuals was probably scanty, and their confinement
unnatural, so that they were in an unhealthy and
somewhat meagre state at the time of their imprisonment.
We can therefore scarcely argue with certainty from the
death of all these individuals within two years, as to the
duration of life which might have been maintained had
they retired spontaneously, and fallen into the torpor of
their natural hibernation in good bodily condition.</p>

<p>"The results of our experiments amount to this: all the
Toads, both large and small, inclosed in sandstone, and
the small Toads in the limestone also, were dead at the
end of thirteen months. Before the expiration of the
second year all the large ones also were dead; these were
examined several times during the second year through
the glass covers of the cells, but without removing them
to admit air; they appeared always awake, with their eyes
open, and never in a state of torpor, their meagreness
increasing at each interval in which they were examined,
until at length they were found dead; those two also
which had gained an accession of weight at the end of
the first year, and were then carefully closed up again,
were emaciated and dead before the expiration of the
second year.</p>

<p>"At the same time that these Toads were inclosed in
stone, four other Toads of middling size were inclosed in
three holes, cut for this purpose on the north side of the
trunk of an apple-tree; two being placed in the largest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
cell, and each of the others in a single cell. The cells
were nearly circular, about five inches deep and three
inches in diameter; they were carefully closed up with a
plug of wood, so as to exclude access of insects, and apparently
were air-tight; when examined at the end of a
year, every one of the Toads was dead, and their bodies
were decayed.</p>

<p>"From the fatal result of the experiments made in the
small cells cut in the apple-tree and the block of compact
sandstone, it seems to follow that Toads cannot live a year
excluded totally from atmospheric air; and, from the
experiments in the larger cells within the block of oolitic
limestone, it seems also probable that they cannot survive
two years entirely excluded from food; we may therefore
conclude that there is a want of sufficiently minute and
accurate observation in those so frequently recorded cases,
where Toads are said to be found alive within blocks of
stone and wood, in cavities that had no communication
whatever with the external air. The fact of my two Toads
having increased in weight at the end of the year, notwithstanding
the care that was taken to inclose them
perfectly by a luting of clay, shews how very small an
aperture will admit of insects sufficient to maintain life.
In the cell No. 5, where the glass was slightly cracked,
the communication though small was obvious, but in the
cell No. 9, where the glass cover remained entire, and
where it appears certain, from the increased weight of the
inclosed animal, that insects must have found admission,
we have an example of these minute animals finding their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
way into a cell to which great care had been taken to
prevent any possibility of access.</p>

<p>"Admitting, then, that Toads are occasionally found in
cavities of wood and stone with which there is no communication
sufficiently large to allow the ingress and
egress of the animal inclosed in them, we may, I think,
find a solution of such phenomena in the habits of these
reptiles, and of the insects which form their food. The
first effort of the young Toad, as soon as it has left its tadpole
state and emerged from the water, is to seek shelter
in holes and crevices of rocks and trees. An individual
which, when young, may have thus entered a cavity by
some very narrow aperture, would find abundance of food
by catching insects, which, like itself, seek shelter within
such cavities; and may soon have increased so much in
bulk as to render it impossible to get out again through
the narrow aperture at which it entered. A small hole
of this kind is very likely to be overlooked by common
workmen, who are the only people whose operations on
stone and wood disclose cavities in the interior of such
substances.</p>

<p>"In the case of Toads, Snakes, and Lizards, that occasionally
issue from stones that are broken in a quarry, or
in sinking wells, and sometimes even from strata of coal at
the bottom of a coal-mine, the evidence is never perfect
to shew that the reptiles were entirely inclosed in solid
rock. No examination is ever made until the reptile is
first discovered by the breaking of the mass in which it
was contained, and then it is too late to ascertain, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
carefully replacing every fragment, (and in no case that I
have seen reported has this ever been done,) whether or
not there was any hole or crevice by which the animal
may have entered the cavity from which it was extracted.
Without previous examination it is almost impossible to
prove that there was no such communication. In the
case of rocks near the surface of the earth, and in stone
quarries, reptiles find ready admission to holes and fissures.
We have a notorious example of this kind in the Lizard
found in a chalk-pit, and brought alive to the late Dr
Clark. In the case also of wells and coal-pits, a reptile
that had fallen down the well or shaft, and survived its
fall, would seek its natural retreat in the first hole or
crevice it could find, and the miner dislodging it from
this cavity, to which his previous attention had not been
called, might in ignorance conclude that the animal was
coeval with the stone from which he had extracted it.</p>

<p>"It remains only to consider the case (of which I know
not any authenticated example) of Toads that have been
said to be found in cavities within blocks of limestone, to
which, on careful examination, no access whatever could
be discovered, and where the animal was absolutely and
entirely closed up with stone. Should any such case ever
have existed, it is probable that the communication between
this cavity and the external surface had been closed
up by stalactitic incrustation, after the animal had become
too large to make its escape. A similar explanation
may be offered of the much more probable case of a
live Toad being entirely surrounded with solid wood. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
each case, the animal would have continued to increase in
bulk so long as the smallest aperture remained by which
air and insects could find admission; it would probably
become torpid as soon as this aperture was entirely closed
by the accumulation of stalactite or the growth of wood.
But it still remains to be ascertained how long this state
of torpor may continue under total exclusion from food
and from external air: and, although the experiments
above recorded shew that life did not extend two years
in the case of any one of the individuals which formed
the subjects of them, yet, for reasons which have been
specified, they are not decisive to shew that a state of
torpor, or suspended animation, may not be endured for
a much longer time by Toads that are healthy and well fed
up to the moment when they are finally cut off from food,
and from all direct access of atmospheric air.</p>

<p>"The common experiment of burying a Toad in a flower-pot
covered with a tile, is of no value unless the cover be
carefully luted to the pot, and the hole at the bottom of
the pot also closed, so as to exclude all possible access of
air, earthworms, and insects. I have heard of two or
three experiments of this kind, in which these precautions
have not been taken, and in which at the end of a year
the Toads have been found alive and well.</p>

<p>"Besides the Toads inclosed in wood and stone, four
others were placed each in a small basin of plaster of
Paris, four inches deep and five inches in diameter, having
a cover of the same material carefully luted round with
clay; these were buried at the same time and in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
place with the blocks of stone, and on being examined at
the same time with them in December 1826, two of the
Toads were dead, the other two alive, but much emaciated.
We can only collect from this experiment, that a thin
plate of plaster of Paris is permeable to air in a sufficient
degree to maintain the life of a Toad for thirteen months.</p>

<p>"In the 19th Vol., No. I, p. 167, of <i>Sillimans American
Journal of Science and Arts</i>, David Thomas, Esq.
has published some observations on Frogs and Toads in
stone and solid earth, enumerating several authentic and
well-attested cases. These, however, amount to no more
than a repetition of the facts so often stated and admitted
to be true, viz., that torpid reptiles occur in cavities of
stone, and at the depth of many feet in soil and earth;
but they state not anything to disprove the possibility of
a small aperture, by which these cavities may have had
communication with the external surface, and insects
have been admitted.</p>

<p>"The attention of the discoverer is always directed more
to the Toad than to the minuti&aelig; of the state of the cavity
in which it was contained."</p>

<p>The importance of these experiments, the care with
which they were instituted, the deserved reputation of
the experimenter, and the philosophic character of his
inferences, will, I trust, apologise for the extent of this
quotation. I do not think, however, that the question is
settled by them; and I will venture to make one or two
comments on the facts and on the observations.</p>

<p>Dr Buckland allows that the circumstances of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
incarceration of his Toads were not natural. This seems
to me an element of more importance than he attributes
to it. They were shut up while in active life, after having
been confined for two months on scanty food;&mdash;"So that
they were in an <i>unhealthy and somewhat meagre</i> state at
the time of their imprisonment." We do not know what
conditions, what natural provisions precede torpidity and
are essential to it; but possibly there are some, which in
these cases were compulsorily precluded by human interference.
It is stated that the animals that survived to
the second year were always found awake when examined,&mdash;"<i>never
in a state of torpor</i>." But Toads that had hid
themselves would have been torpid during the winter
months; and thus we have a sufficient proof that a
natural condition of body had been by some means prevented.
The experiment would be much more fair to the
Toad, and much more conclusive to me, if the animal were
inclosed during the depth of its winter-sleep, care being
taken to handle it as little as possible.</p>

<p>As it was, however, <i>most of the Toads</i> inclosed in the
limestone <i>survived upwards of thirteen months</i>. This
surely is a very remarkable fact. Take the case of No. 9.
Here was a Toad, nearly full grown, which had been shut
up in a stone cell, covered with a plate of glass carefully
luted down all round, so as to exclude air, buried under
three feet of earth, so as to exclude the smallest gleam of
light; yet, at the expiration of thirteen months, the cell
being examined in winter, when normally all Toads ought
to be sound asleep, this Toad was wide awake, not in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
least emaciated, but so thriving in its strange dungeon as
actually to have made 128 grains of flesh! to have actually
increased in weight at the rate of 12&#189; per cent.!</p>

<p>Dr Buckland says, "It is probable there was some
aperture in the luting by which small insects found
admission." But this is altogether a <i>petitio principii</i>: it
absolutely begs the question at issue. Are not these
insects entirely gratuitous? The luting was, of course,
carefully laid on: there could be no drying to cause contraction,
buried as it was in the earth; the glass was
uninjured; no orifice was detected; and yet, forsooth,
it must be assumed that "small insects found admission."
Then, too, consider the problem. It is not the possibility
that a microscopically minute insect or two may have
managed in some inscrutable way to insinuate themselves,
but insects sufficient to support this large Toad for thirteen
months, and to make it at the end of that time 128
grains heavier than it was when first inclosed! There is
the fact, as stated by this careful observer; and I am
sure his hypothesis of intrusive insects will not account
for it.</p>

<p>I might make similar remarks on No. 5. The glass
was "<i>slightly</i> cracked." No insects were discovered in
it; nor is any perceptible orifice alluded to; yet this Toad
had increased from 1185 grains to 1265 grains. The
"<i>slight</i> crack" in the glass makes this example less
remarkable at first sight than the other; but in reality it
is equally inscrutable. Insects, however minute, do not
pass through glass merely cracked; but the requirement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
is the admission of insects enough to make an increase of
flesh of 80 grains' weight, besides maintaining the waste of
the Toad during thirteen months. Where, in each case, was
the excrement corresponding to such an augmentation?
An insect-diet, as every naturalist knows, leaves a very
considerable residuum of indigestible, incorruptible, chitinous
matter: the f&oelig;cal remains of an insect-diet sufficient
to keep an adult Toad in condition for thirteen
months, and leave him 128 grains heavier than at first,
would form no inconsiderable or inconspicuous mass.
Yet the silence of the observer on so conclusive an evidence
proves that it was utterly wanting.</p>

<p>The Toads which survived longest were the largest
specimens. Perhaps it requires a condition of peculiar
vigour to bear the incarceration. Even these were all
dead before two years had elapsed. But then it must be
remembered that they had been disturbed: they had
been taken out, handled, and weighed, and replaced; and
during the second year they had been examined "several
times." Air, it is true, was not admitted in these later
examinations; but <i>light was</i>; and it may be that the
absence of all external stimulus (and light is a potent
one) is indispensable to the prolongation of vitality under
conditions so abnormal.</p>

<p>No one supposes that incarceration in solid rock is
an ordinary event in the life of even a Toad. However
it occur,&mdash;granting that it may occur,&mdash;it must
surely be a rare accident happening to an individual here
and there, from which millions of Toads are exempt. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
may reasonably suppose, too, that not one in a hundred
so accidentally incarcerated would survive, the accident in
the majority of cases proving fatal. If we bear in mind
these not unreasonable presumptions, we shall not hastily
decide that all the recorded discoveries of Toads immured
are proved false and impossible, because we have not
succeeded in finding a case of longevity out of four-and-twenty
Toads, many of them little ones, which we took
and violently immured at our pleasure.</p>

<p>To my own mind these interesting experiments are far
more corroborative than contradictory of the popular
belief. The amazing fact remains, that an adult vertebrate
air-breathing animal can certainly live, and increase
in size, shut up in a stone cell, debarred from light and
air and food, for a period between one and two years!
What have we parallel to this in the whole range of
natural history? <i>C'est le premier pas qui co&ucirc;te.</i> After
the first year has passed so auspiciously, why may not a
second? a third? and so indefinitely&mdash;under circumstances
peculiarly favouring? It is by no means certain that there
are not such favouring circumstances, because we cannot
precisely predicate what they are. And if we admit the
reported cases to be&mdash;only a few of them&mdash;true, we cannot
evade the conclusion, that the longevity of these imprisoned
Toads must be immense, incalculable. For a
Toad that emerges when a block of stone is split up,
from a matrix that fits (say somewhat roughly, if you
please) its form and size, must have been there ever since
the stone was in a soft state, how long soever that may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
have been. Nor does it in the least affect the question,
that there may have been some minute crack in the
matrix through which insects, sufficient to support life,
entered. This circumstance, I say, if satisfactorily proved,
would not touch the question of time. And surely it is
a marvel of colossal magnitude that a vertebrate animal
should have maintained its life shut up in a mass of
stone ever since the deposition of the matter in a solid
form, even though we be able to eliminate from it the
element of total abstinence during the entire period.</p>

<p>But facts are upon record which prove the possibility
of Toads surviving a protracted incarceration, effected by
man, and therefore without their will. In 1809, on
opening a gap in a wall at Bamborough, in Northumberland,
for the passage of carts, a Toad, which had been
incarcerated in the centre of a wall, was found alive, and
set at liberty. A mason, named George Wilson, when
building this wall, sixteen years before, had wantonly
immured the animal, in a close cavity formed of lime and
stone, just sufficient to contain it, and which he plastered
so closely as seemingly to prevent the admission of air.
When discovered, it seemed at first, as must naturally be
supposed, in a very torpid state; but it soon recovered
animation and activity, and, as if sensible of the blessings
of freedom, made its way to a collection of stones, and
disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Mr F. W. L. Ross of Broadway House, near Topsham,
an acute and experienced naturalist, narrates the follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>ing
circumstances:&mdash;"In the year 1821, I was residing in
the country, and in my court-yard was a set of stone steps
for mounting on horseback. These being useless to me,
I desired they might be removed. On taking them down,
the lowest step, a coarse red conglomerate, measuring
about three feet in length, ten inches in depth, and about
fourteen in width, was raised by a heavy bar. It had
been well bedded in mortar, in which, while soft, a Toad
had been evidently placed, as there was no appearance of
any way by which it could have found ingress or egress,
the mould or cast being as perfect as if taken in plaster.
On the removal of the stone, the Toad remained torpid for
a few minutes, when it seemed to revive, and then crept
out. From the owners of the property I ascertained that
the steps had been placed there forty-five years before, and,
to the best of their knowledge, had never been moved.</p>

<p>"The second account is from a clergyman, and originated
in my informing him of the above. He caused
a pit to be dug in his garden, six feet deep; at the
bottom was laid a slate, on which a full-sized Toad was
placed, with an inverted flower-pot over it. The hole
and edges were well luted with clay; the pit was then
filled in, and on that day twelve months reopened, when
the Toad was found alive, and as well as when inclosed in
its living tomb. If, therefore, it could exist in such a
state for twelve months, it is not impossible that it might
do so for a much longer period."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>These curious facts derive confirmation and augmented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>interest from some apparently parallel conditions observed
of other animals, widely removed in the organic
scale from the Reptilia, and that on both sides. Some
glimpses of an indefinitely protracted torpidity in Wasps
are given to us in a communication from an eminent entomologist,
Mr G. Wailes of Newcastle, to the Entomological
Society of London, and published in their "Proceedings"
of March 5, 1860. These Rip Van Winkles of the insect
race choose, it seems, the tops of loftiest mountains for
going to their long sleep. Who knows what might be
found if a clever insect-hunter were to go stone-turning on
the peaks of Ararat? Read the following, young enterprising
entomologists! and set out.</p>

<p>"It is very evident that we have a great deal yet to
learn about the Social Wasps, and therefore the following
remarks as to <i>Vespa vulgaris</i> may be interesting. Ever
since 1829 I have, at intervals, searched the summit of
Skiddaw (3022 feet) for specimens of <i>Leistus montanus</i>,
and on every occasion have taken out from underneath the
loose fragments of the slate perfectly torpid females of
this Wasp, with the wings, legs, antenn&aelig;, &amp;c., precisely in
the state in which we find them during winter in the
lower lands. Not unfrequently I have met with dead
specimens which seemed to have perished in the same
dormant state, and been there for a year or two at least.
Mr Smith, in his catalogue of the British Vespad&aelig;, under
this species, states that Mr Wollaston found the female
abundant under stones on the extreme summit of Gribon
Oernant, near Llangollen, in September 1854, adding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
'probably hybernating for the winter,' but had evidently
forgotten my writing to him on the subject. My visits to
the mountain have extended from the latter end of June
to the latter end of August, and therefore it necessarily
follows that either these specimens of the female Wasp
were those of the previous year, or that this sex appears
much earlier in the season than has hitherto been supposed.
But in either case the question arises, why are
they torpid during these the hottest months of the year?
It is quite true that the temperature of the altitude is
below that of the plains, especially during the night, and
I have myself been enveloped in falling sleet and snow
more than once, both in June and August, though, as a
rule, the Cumberland mountains seldom have a thick
covering of snow, and often only a few inches once or
twice in the winter. Still, the temperature of ordinary
mountains always approaches that of the plains in summer,
and, one would have expected, was in Britain at least sufficiently
high to rouse these Wasps in their winter quarters,
when every other insect under the same stones was
active and stirring, and the air so warm and bright that
<i>Larentia salicata</i> and <i>Crambus furcatillus</i> were sporting
in the mid-day sun above them. Such, however, was
not the case, and when turned out of their snug, dry
quarters, they allowed themselves to be handled and put
into pill-boxes just as they do in winter. We may therefore
ask, when are these sleepers to awake? for as the
ground temperature reaches its maximum during the
months in which I have met with them, and Mr Wollas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>ton
has found them in a similar state in September, when
a declining temperature has set in, we must conclude that
for that year all prospect of their subsequent issue from
their retreats through the influence of heat is barred. Can
this be called hybernation, as it is usually understood?
Or is there some other cause of torpidity besides mere
cold? Or are we to conclude that when once put to sleep
in these lofty regions, they wake no more unless kindly
removed into a milder clime by a stray entomologist, when,
as I have always noticed, they become as active as those
of the warm lowlands?"<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Mr Westwood, in the conversation that ensued on this
communication, suggested that these female Wasps had
been the founders of colonies in the preceding spring, and,
after performing their maternal duties, had retired to die
in the situations in which they were found by Mr Wailes.
But with all due deference to so great an authority, is not
this another example of those "explanations" which are
thrown off without a due consideration of the exigencies
of the case in hand&mdash;explanations which really explain
nothing? For though this hypothesis might account for
Wasps found under such conditions in June, it will not do
for the September findings. Insects that had performed
the end of their existence and had retired to die in June,
would not live through July and August, and be found
alive in September. Besides, Mr Wailes distinctly affirms,
that <i>they always become active</i> when removed to a milder
clime, which is proof positive that they had not retired to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>die. Mr Smith's hypothesis, that they are "probably hybernating
for the winter," will not account for their torpidity
in June and July. Mr Westwood's hypothesis, that
they are moribund individuals after their spring work,
will not explain their vitality till September, and their
revivification when removed.</p>

<p>But these are insects; and the difference between vertebrate
and invertebrate life is so vast that, after all, the
possibilities of the latter may not have much bearing on
those of the former. What, then, shall we say to an
indefinite prolongation of life under like dreary conditions
in&mdash;<i>Bats</i>? <i>Bats</i>, which are true vertebrata; and
no amphibia grovelling at the bottom of the vertebrate
ladder, where the dim flame of spinal life is just glimmering
in the socket, but <i>Mammalia</i>, and those of nearly the
highest type;&mdash;<i>Bats</i>, which Linn&aelig;us associated with
<i>Homo sapiens</i> himself in his first Order <i>Primates</i>! Can
<i>these</i> live for years shut up from light and food and air?
these great-chested, well-lunged, warm-blooded, aerial
quadrupeds? "Impossible! I would not believe it, if&mdash;&mdash;"
Stay! make no rash vows; but read, weigh,
and judge. Remember,&mdash;both the following statements
are by clergymen, each of whom is a well-known, careful,
experienced naturalist.</p>

<p>"A very curious instance," says Mr Pemberton Bartlett,
"of the great length of time that a Bat can remain in a
state of torpidity, came under my notice about three
weeks since; and as I believe instances of the kind are
but rarely observed, perhaps an account of the facts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>the case may not prove uninteresting. Upon opening a
vault in Bishopsbourne church, the bricklayer observed a
large Bat clinging to the wall. Thinking it a curious
thing to find a Bat in a vault which he knew had not
been opened for twenty years, in the evening he sent it to
me by his boy, who, when he arrived at the door, was
tempted to open the basket to look at the inmate, when
most unfortunately it made its escape, and flitted into a
leaden spout which was placed against the house, from
whence I was unable to recover it. Upon learning the
particulars of its discovery, I made a careful search about
the vault, but was unable to trace any hole or crack
through which the smallest Bat could have crept. The
bricklayer also informed me that there was no place where
a Bat could have entered, in the part where he opened the
vault, as the entrance was bricked up, and over the steps
was a slab which fitted close. If, indeed, it had been
possible for a Bat to have got between this, the brickwork
at the entrance would most effectually have prevented it
from finding an asylum in the vault. The natural inference
therefore is, that the Bat must have got into the
vault when it was last opened, and consequently had
been entombed since the year 1823! It was most
unfortunate that I was unable to decide what species
it was; but, from the bricklayer's description, I think it
must have been <i>Vespertilio Pipistrellus</i>. When first
taken out of the vault it was in a torpid state, but the
effects of the air may be imagined from its taking the
first opportunity to escape in the evening; it flew, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ever,
far more 'leaden winged' than ever bats are wont to
fly, which was by no means marvellous, when we consider
it had been out of practice for twenty-one years."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The next account, by the Rev. A. C. Smith, of Yatesbury
Rectory, Calne, is one of peculiar interest. The narrator
actually witnessed the discovery. His investigation
was pursued with the cautious care, and his statement is
made with the precision, which belong to science; and the
details are so full, and his remarks so appropriate, that
though the story is somewhat long, I cannot bring myself
to abridge it. It bears date, Feb. 18, 1854. Of course,
the reader will note how these two narratives yield each
other mutual corroboration.</p>

<p>"While effecting some repairs in the pavement of the
aisle of my church, a short time since, the masons found
it necessary to remove some bricks from the solid wall of
an adjacent vault, in order the better to adjust an iron
bar intended to support the superincumbent flagstone.
It seems that one or two bricks being removed, and
several large and handsome coffins being exposed to view,
curiosity tempted one of the workmen to reach his hand
in with a lighted candle, in order to see the names and
dates on the coffins; the result of which investigation
shewed that the last coffin was placed there in 1748.
During this search I entered the church, just in time to
witness the extreme surprise, and the no little consternation,
of the man, whose hand had suddenly come in contact
with a Bat, suspended from the roof of the vault.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
The Bat was soon brought to light; and, in its half-torpid
state, placed in my hand. We then proceeded to make a
very minute examination of this vault with a lighted candle,
in order to discover, if possible, by what means the
Bat could have penetrated to its resting-place: but, although
our search was very careful and long continued,
we failed to discover the smallest crack or crevice in
which a pin could be thrust. The roof was an arch of
brick, surmounted by flagstones; the sides were solid
masonry, bearing no appearance internally of decay; and
the position of the vault was very near the centre of the
church: so that I was much puzzled to account for the
occurrence of the Bat in a place apparently hermetically
sealed for above a hundred years; and knew not how to
combat the opinion of the workmen, that it must have
been entombed there alive since the year 1748.</p>

<p>"I now proceeded to institute inquiries regarding the
vault in which the Bat was found. The marble monument
above, recorded the names of an old Wiltshire family
long since extinct in these parts, and the dates of the
three coffins below, corroborating the statement of the
brass plate, that the individual last buried died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1748. Several old men in the parish remembered an adjacent
vault being opened, when they were boys, nearly
sixty years since: but all positively denied that the vault
in question had ever been opened in their lives: and one,
a very old man, formerly clerk, and whose then residence
abutted on the churchyard, was very emphatic on this
point. So that I am constrained to believe that the vault<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
has remained untouched since it received its last occupant,
a hundred and six years ago: and I am the more convinced
of this from the excessive freshness of the last coffin,
the brass plate and nails of which are as bright, and
its whole appearance as new, as if it had been placed there
but yesterday, which would not have been the case had
the external air been admitted at any time since the vault
was closed.</p>

<p>"During the time of the examination of the vault, the
Bat was held in my hand, and above an hour must have
elapsed since its capture before I was enabled to take it to
the Rectory, and place it under an inverted glass: by this
time the warmth of my hand had considerably revived it,
and it wandered round its prison, snuffing about with its
curious nose, and standing up, and trying to hook itself
on to the smooth glass, which baffled all its attempts.
As it obstinately refused to eat small pieces of chopped
meat, with which I tempted it to break its fast, which
may have continued a hundred and six years, and after
which I should have imagined it to be ravenous; and as
it lay on its side, apparently in a dying state, humanity
urged me to give it a chance of life, by restoring it to
liberty, and I accordingly carried it to the garden, where
I placed it upon the turf, and watched its movements.
At first it clung to the blades of grass, and shivered a
good deal; presently it fluttered along the ground; soon
it rose upon the wing, though in an awkward manner,
and although it sank several times, as if about to fall to
the ground, and as if it had not found the use of its wings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
(which might have been a little stiff for want of exercise,
if they had been closed above a hundred years), it passed
behind a clump of trees and I saw it no more; and then
I began to regret, when too late, that I had not made
more efforts to keep it alive and watch its recovery. I
know little of the different species of Bats, but, from its
diminutive size, and extremely long ears, I should imagine
it to be the <i>Vespertilio auritus</i> of Gilbert White.</p>

<p>"Now, if the hypothesis be deemed absurd that the Bat
had been immured in the vault since 1748, how then are
we to account for its presence there? For although I am
aware that a Bat, and especially one of the smallest species,
would creep through a very small crack or crevice, yet the
evidence of my own senses, after a very close examination,
convinces me that not even the smallest crack existed between
the bricks of the vault; and I think the evidence
no less conclusive that the vault has remained untouched
for a great number of years. Again, notwithstanding the
disbelief of some, it is very generally acknowledged that
Toads do occasionally exist in blocks of stone and in timber;
and the material in which they are inclosed having
gradually formed around them, they must necessarily have
been entombed, in some well-authenticated cases, for a
very long period of time. Why then, I ask, should we
deny that to be possible with the Bat, which we so readily
concede to be an occurrence by no means unusual with
the Toad? I own, that, taking all these things into account,
and finding no other possible solution for the mystery,
I came to the conclusion, after mature deliberation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
that the Bat had been entombed in the vault since it last
was opened in the year 1748. That impression has increased
upon longer reflection, and has been further
strengthened almost into certainty, from the perusal of a
very interesting and very similar case, recorded by the
Rev. J. P. Bartlett in an early volume of the <i>Zoologist</i>
(<i>Zool.</i>, 613.)<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> That gentleman states, that on opening a
vault which had been closed for twenty-one years, a Bat
was discovered in a torpid state; that he himself made a
very careful search about the vault, and was unable to
discover any crack through which the smallest Bat could
have crept; that the vault was surrounded with brickwork;
the entrance was bricked up, and over the steps was
placed a close-fitting slab; and that he could come to no
other conclusion than that the Bat had been inclosed there
for twenty-one years. I confess that I quite agree in
opinion with Mr Bartlett, and believe that the Bat discovered
in the vault in Bishopsbourne church crept in on
the occasion of its last opening: and so in the like manner
with the one found in my own church; for although there
is unquestionably a vast difference between twenty-one
and a hundred and six years, yet, if we can establish the
fact of a Bat remaining torpid for the shorter period, I
find no difficulty in understanding that a sleep which
would endure so long as that did, might be protracted
to a far longer period. It is most probable that many
will differ from me in opinion, and perhaps some will
ridicule the idea: if they can discover any other pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>bable
or even possible means of accounting for the presence
of the Bat in the vault, exclusive of a crack or chink in
it, or of its having been opened within the memory of living
man, both of which views I firmly oppose, I shall feel
greatly obliged by their stating their opinions in the
<i>Zoologist</i>: meanwhile I hold to my belief, that the Bat
had been there for not less than <i>one hundred and six
years</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<h2>HYBERNATION OF SWALLOWS.</h2>


<p>What becomes of our swallows in the winter? They
migrate, you reply, to a warmer parallel. That is true,
no doubt; though there have not been wanting naturalists
of respectable name who have maintained that none
of them ever leave the country. No doubt, however, they
do migrate; but is this true of the entire body, or only
of a portion? That the whole hirundinal population&mdash;swifts,
swallows, martins, and bank-martins&mdash;disappear
from view, every one knows; for who ever saw any of the
tribe wheeling and traversing through the sky in the
frosts of January or February? But so do the Bats and
the Butterflies. Now, the Bats hybernate with us, concealing
themselves in crevices, caves, hollow trees, unused
buildings, and similar places; so do the house-flies; so
do the butterflies, some species at least, and many other
insects. Do the Swallows hybernate? That they do
is a very old opinion; and those homely but wide-spread
rhymes that record so many accepted facts in popular
natural history, record <i>this</i> as a fact. Our rustic children
sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">"The bat, the bee, the butterfly,</span><br />
<span class="i2">The cuckoo and the swallow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The corn-crake and the wheat-ear,</span><br />

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>
<p>Local variations&mdash;what we may call <i>lectiones vari&aelig;</i>&mdash;exist;
for example, in the south-east of our island, the third line
runs,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">"The corn-crake and the <i>nightingale</i>."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>In the north of Europe an opinion has long prevailed
that the Swallows not only hybernate in a state of torpidity,
but, like the frogs and toads, retire to the bottoms
of pools to spend that dreary season. In Berger's "Calendar
of Flora," published in the <i>Am&oelig;nitates Academic&aelig;</i>,
vol. iv., he puts down as the phenomenon proper to the
22d of September, "<i>Hirundo submergitur</i>," talking, as
Gilbert White remarks, as familiarly of the Swallows going
under water, as he would of his poultry going to roost at
sunset. Klein, and even Linn&aelig;us himself, adopted this
strange opinion, which was considered to rest upon good
testimony, and that not only of the illiterate and unobservant.
Etmuller, who was Professor of Anatomy and Botany
at Leipsig in the middle of the seventeenth century, says,
"I remember to have found more than a bushel would
hold of Swallows closely clustered among the reeds of a
fish-pond under the ice, all of them to appearance dead,
but with the heart still pulsating." And Derham, the
acute author of "Physico-theology," citing this statement,
adds, "We had at a meeting of the Royal Society, February
12, 1713, a further confirmation of Swallows retiring
under water in the winter from Dr Colas, a person very
curious in these matters, who, speaking of their way of
fishing in the northern parts by breaking holes and drawing
their nets under the ice, saith, that he saw sixteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Swallows so drawn out of the Lake of Lamrodt, and about
thirty out of the king's great pond in Rosneilen; and
that at Schlehitten, near a house of the Earl of Dohna, he
saw two Swallows just come out of the waters, that could,
scarcely stand, being very wet and weak, with their wings
hanging on the ground; and that he observed the Swallows
to be often weak for some days after their appearance."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The Academy of Upsal received the winter submersion
of the Swallows as an undoubted fact, and even Cuvier
admits as "well authenticated, that they fall into a
lethargic state during winter, and even that they pass that
season at the bottom of marshy waters."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> One would
think that a zoological statement which Linn&aelig;us and
Cuvier accepted, must be fact; yet it remains utterly improbable.
In Germany, a reward of an equal weight in
silver was publicly offered to any one who should produce
Swallows found under water, but we are assured that no
one was found to claim the money.</p>

<p>We may safely dismiss the notion of submersion till
better authenticated; but that of torpidity is still open to
examination. Statements to the effect that quantities of
Swallows in a death-like condition have been found in
hollow trees, holes in cliffs, banks, &amp;c., are even more
common than those of their submersion; and they seem
to obtain credence in all the temperate or cold regions
where the Swallows are found. It is hard to think that a
persuasion so widely diffused can be wholly groundless.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>Peter Collinson, the friend and correspondent of Linn&aelig;us,
communicated to the Royal Society the following
statement by M. Achard:&mdash;"In the latter end of March I
took my passage down the Rhine to Rotterdam. A little
below Basel, the south bank of the river was very high
and steep, of a sandy soil, sixty or eighty feet above the
water.</p>

<p>"I was surprised at seeing, near the top of the cliff,
some boys tied to ropes, hanging down doing something.
The singularity of these adventurous boys, and the business
they so daringly attempted, made us stop our navigation,
to inquire into the meaning of it. The waterman
told us they were reaching the holes in the cliffs for
Swallows or Martins, which took refuge in them, and remained
there all the winter, until warm weather, and
then they came abroad.</p>

<p>"The boys being let down by their comrades to the
holes, put in a long rammer, with a screw at the end, such
as is used to unload guns, and, twisting it about, drew out
the birds. For a trifle I procured some of them. When
I first had them, they seemed stiff and lifeless; I put one
of them in my bosom, between my skin and shirt, and
laid another on a board, the sun shining full and warm
upon it; and one or two of my companions did the like.
That in my bosom revived in about a quarter of an hour;
feeling it move, I took it out to look at it; but perceiving
it not sufficiently come to itself, I put it in again; in
about another quarter, feeling it flutter pretty briskly, I
took it out, and admired it. Being now perfectly re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>covered,
before I was aware, it took its flight; the covering
of the boat prevented me from seeing where it went.
The bird on the board, though exposed to a full sun, yet,
I presume from a chilliness of the air, did not revive so as
to be able to fly."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>On this account I may observe that Collinson would
hardly have been the medium of this communication,
unless he had been satisfied of the probity of his correspondent.
The time was "the latter end of March," a
fortnight at least before the arrival of the Sand Martin&mdash;the
earliest of our migrants; and the whole enterprise of
the boys, and the familiarity of the waterman with the
circumstance, as well as their assertions, shew that they,
at least, had no doubt about this being a case of hybernation.
Yet the repeated exploration of the Sand Martin's
burrows in this country, in winter, has produced no birds.</p>

<p>White of Selborne, who was very much interested in
the solution of this question, mentions two instances&mdash;both,
however, on hearsay evidence. A clergyman assured
him that, when he was a boy, some workmen, in pulling
down the battlements of a tower, early in spring, found
two or three Swifts <i>among the rubbish</i>, which appeared
dead, but revived in the warmth. The other account was
that of the fall of a portion of the cliff near Brighton in
winter, when many persons found Swallows among the
rubbish; but here even White's informant did not see the
birds, but was merely told of them.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Stanley, in his "Familiar History of Birds," has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>collected some stories which appear circumstantial enough,
if we could be quite sure they were authentic; on which
point the good bishop seems to give the weight of his
own character, since he observes that they are "cases
which have come to our knowledge, on the most respectable
authority."</p>

<p>"On the 16th of November 1826, a gentleman residing
near Loch Awe, in Scotland, having occasion to examine
an out-house, used as a cart-shed, saw an unusual appearance
upon one of the rafters which crossed and supported
the thatched roof. Upon mounting a ladder, he found to
his astonishment that this was a group of Chimney-swallows
(<i>Hirundo rustica</i>) which had taken up their winter
quarters in this exposed situation. The group consisted
of five, completely torpid: and none of the tribe to which
they belonged had been seen for five or six weeks previously:
he took them in his hand, as they lay closely
and coldly huddled together, and conveyed them to his
house, in order to exhibit them as objects of curiosity to
the other members of his family. For some time they
remained to all appearance lifeless; but the temperature
of the apartment into which they were carried being
considerably raised by a good turf fire, they gradually
evinced symptoms of reanimation; and in less than a
quarter of an hour, finding that they were rather rudely
handled, all of them recovered, so as to fly impatiently
round the room, in search of some opening by which they
might escape. The window was thrown up, and they
soon found their way into the fields, and were never seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
again. A similar circumstance, though, from the place of
its discovery it must refer probably to Sand Martins, was
related by a gentleman who found two Swallows in a
sand-bank at Newton, near Stirling, quite dormant.</p>

<p>"Again, about half-a-dozen Swallows were found a few
years ago, in a torpid state, in the trunk of a hollow tree,
by a countryman, who brought them to a respectable
person, by whom they were deposited in a desk, where
they remained forgotten till the following spring, when,
one morning, on hearing a noise, he opened the desk, and
found one of them fluttering about: the others also began
to shew signs of life, and upon being placed out of doors
in the sun, speedily arranged their plumage, took wing,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>"On the 2d of November 1829, at Loch Ransa, in the
island of Arran, a man, while digging in a place where a
pond had been lately drained off, discovered two Swallows
in a state of torpor; on placing them near the fire, they
recovered. One unfortunately escaped, but the other was
kept by the man, for the purpose of shewing it to some
scientific persons."</p>

<p>In North America there is a curious species of Swift,
(<i>Acanthylis pelasgia</i>,) which associates in immense flocks
to roost in chimneys and hollow trees. It is the popular
belief that these birds spend the winter in a torpid condition
in their roosting trees. Williams, in his "History of
Vermont," speaks of a large hollow elm which had been
for many years appropriated to this purpose. A farmer
resident close to the tree was persuaded that it was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
winter dwelling-place of the Swifts, and avoided felling it
on that account. About the 1st of May, he always saw
them come out of it in large numbers, about the middle
of the day, and in a short time return. Then, as the
weather grew warmer, they came forth in increased multitudes
in the morning, and did not return till night. A
similar account was given of another tree: the first appearance
of the Swifts in spring was always their emergence
from its hollow trunk, and their last, in September,
was their ingress. Yet Wilson, the great ornithologist of
America, argues, not without some heat, yet with considerable
force, that such a belief is erroneous. Erroneous,
certainly, the supposition that the whole body of the
Chimney-swifts so hybernate; but whether a few do or do
not, his arguments do not quite conclude.</p>

<p>The rustic quatrain, quoted in the outset of this disquisition,
mentions the Corncrake, as associated with the
Swallow in this winter-sleep,&mdash;"in the hollow." It is
curious that two modern instances are on record of hybernating
Corncrakes, though this is certainly as migratory a
species with us as the <i>Hirundinid&aelig;</i>. A farmer at Aikerness
in Orkney, about midwinter, in demolishing a mud-wall,
found a Corncrake in the midst of it. It was apparently
lifeless; but being fresh to the feel and smell, it
was placed in the warmth. In a short time it began to
move, and in a few hours was able to walk about, and
lived for two days in the kitchen; when refusing all food,
or rather, none that suited it being then obtainable, it died.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>"The second case occurred at Monaghan, in Ireland,
where a gentleman, having directed his labourers, in
winter, to remove a large heap of manure, that had remained
undisturbed for a great length of time, perceived
a hole, which was supposed to have been made by rats;
it penetrated to a great depth, but at its termination, instead
of rats, three Corncrakes were discovered, as if placed
there with the greatest care, not a feather being out of its
place, and apparently lifeless. The birds on examination
were, however, considered to be in a torpid state, and were
placed near a fire in a warm room. In the course of a
short time a tremulous motion was observed in one of
their legs, and soon after a similar motion was noticed in
the legs and wings of the whole, which at length extended
itself to their whole bodies, and finally the birds were
enabled to run and fly about the room."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Daines Barrington, the correspondent of Gilbert White
and of Pennant, was a firm believer in the winter sleep of
Swallows with us. He mentions, on the authority of Lord
Belhaven, that numbers of Swallows had been found in
old dry walls and in sandhills near his lordship's seat in
East-Lothian; not once only, <i>but from year to year</i>, and
that when they were exposed to the warmth, they revived.
He says, however, he cannot determine the particular
species.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The same naturalist mentions many other instances in
which they have been reported to be found, but he cannot
give his personal voucher for the truth of the statements.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>"As first in a decayed hollow tree, that was cut down near
Dolgelly, in Merionethshire; secondly, in a cliff near
Whitby, in Yorkshire, where, in digging out a fox, whole
bushels of Swallows were found in a torpid condition;
thirdly, the Rev. Mr Conway, of Lychton, Flintshire, a
few years ago, between All Saints' and Christmas, on
looking down an old lead mine in that county, observed
numbers of Swallows clinging to the timbers of the shaft,
seemingly asleep, and on flinging some gravel on them
they just moved, but never attempted to fly or to change
their place."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>In some communications to the <i>Zoologist</i> for 1845, by
the late Mr F. Holme, of Oxford, I find the following
statement:&mdash;"On the hybernation of this species (the
House-swallow) I was told many years since, by old Wall,
then keeper of the Kildare Street Museum, in Dublin,
... that after a heavy snow, in the winter of 1825-26,
on going into the <i>mansarde</i> to see whether the snow
had melted through, he found four Chimney-swallows
perched close together on a cross-beam, with their heads
under their wings; but on approaching his hand to them
they flew off, and escaped into the open air."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Again, Mr J. B. Ellman of Battel, says, "There is a
farmer named Waters, residing at Catsfield, (adjoining
parish,) who informs me he has frequently (some years
ago) dug Swallows out of banks in winter, while widening
the ditches in the brooks," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>
<p>It is unfortunate that most of these and similar discoveries
were "some years ago;" and that, instead of
increasing in frequency with the increase of scientific
research and communication, they strangely become more
rare. The same remark applies to the following statement:
it is minute enough, and circumstantially precise;
but, unfortunately, it was "fifteen years ago." The communicator
is Edward Brown Fitton, Hastings, under date
September 8, 1849:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A labourer named William Joyce, who is now employed
in excavating part of the East Hill for the foundation
of a house, told me yesterday, that, in the month of
December, about fifteen years ago, while he was working
for Mr William Ranger, who had the contract for cutting
away the 'White Rock,' which used to stand between this
place and St Leonard's, the men found an immense quantity
of Swallows in a cleft of the rock. The birds were
clinging together in large 'clots,' and appeared to be dead,
but were not frozen together, the weather being rather
warm for the season, nor were they at all putrid or
decayed. The men carried out at least <i>three railway-barrows</i>
full of birds, which were buried with the mould
and rubbish from the cliff as it was wheeled away. Some
people from the town carried away a few of the birds to
'make experiments with,' but Joyce never heard any
more of them. He mentioned the names of four persons
now in Hastings, who were then his fellow-labourers, and
says, that forty or fifty of Mr Ranger's men were on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
spot when the birds were found, and can confirm what
he says, both as to the finding and the very great quantity
of the birds. There are many crevices in the seaward
surface of the cliffs about here, which apparently
penetrate the cliff for several yards. The birds were
found about ten feet from the surface of the rock facing
the sea, and not very high up."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>There is yet another class of facts to be adduced,
which has an important bearing on the subject. At first
sight, these facts appear less conclusive than the asserted
discoveries of the birds, because less direct; but I am inclined
to attach more value to them, because they are
attested by so many and so unexceptionable witnesses. I
mean the sight of Swallows at large in these islands during
the winter months. Let us see some examples.</p>

<p>White of Selborne records several cases: thus, in 1773,
twenty or thirty House-martins were playing in the air all
day on the 3d of November,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> after having disappeared
from the 22d of October. In 1772, he saw three House-swallows
gliding by on the sea-shore at Newhaven, on the
4th of November.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> On another occasion, (the year not
being recorded,) he saw, on a sunny morning, a House-martin
flying, at Oxford, on the 20th of November.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> On
the 26th of November 1768, one of his neighbours saw a
Martin hawking briskly after flies.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> And a very respectable
gentleman assured him that on a remarkably hot
day, either in the last week in December or the first week
in January, he espied three or four Swallows in the moulding
of a window of Merton College, Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p><p>Colonel Montagu remarks that "there are a variety of
instances of the Swallow and Martin having been seen flying
in the months of November and December, roused
probably from a state of torpidity by an unusual warmth
of the air;"<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and Captain H. W. Hadfield, commenting
on this, affirms that he has "more than once had ocular
proof of their presence during the winter months."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Yarrell gives examples of the late appearance of the Swift.
One was seen by Mr Blackwall on the 20th of October
1815; a second in Perthshire on the 8th of November
1834; and a third in Devonshire, by the Rev. Mr Cornish,
on the 27th November 1835.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> In considering these
cases, it is needful to bear in mind that the Swift migrates
from this country annually from the 1st to the 15th of
August.</p>

<p>Mr C. R. Bree mentions the following case, which I record,
not because it was particularly late, but because the
state of the season, and some other circumstances which
he remarks on are interesting:&mdash;"On the 25th of October
1848, some workmen being engaged on the roof of my
house, I was surprised by the appearance of three Swallows
flying about the men. I had not seen one since the
beginning of the month. By the side of the edge of the
gable-end of the house the plaster was broken away,
forming a hole, which led under the roof. While watch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>ing
the birds, which came occasionally quite close to my
face, I saw first one, then another, alight upon the ledge
of the gable-end, near the hole. Now, I thought, I am to
settle the question of hybernation: but I was disappointed.
Though I watched them for several hours&mdash;though I sent
the workmen to another part of the house, yet, although
they frequently settled about the hole, they never entered
it. They were evidently young birds, and had been disturbed.
One of them rested upon the chimney, and appeared
weak and dull. I lost sight of them during the
day; but the following morning, the weather being warm,
I saw several flying about high up in the air. There is
some mystery about these things. Why have these late
appearances been more remarked this year than other
years? How did the birds obtain food during the three
weeks of bitter cold weather when they were not seen in
October?"<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>On the 10th of December 1843, a specimen of the Swallow,
<i>an adult bird, not a young of the season</i>, (an important
circumstance,) in full plumage and good condition,
was shot at Goole, in the West Riding, and was sent to
Mr R. J. Bell, of Derby, a good ornithologist,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> who records
the fact. In 1852, that excellent naturalist, Mr Hewitson,
of Oatlands, saw two Chimney-swallows at Eshar on the
18th of November, and on the 21st had four martins
about his house.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> In 1855, Mr E. Vernon Harcourt reports
the occurrence of several Martins skimming about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>at Uckfield on the 23d of November; and on the 6th of
December several Chimney-swallows about the house at
Hastings.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In the same season flocks of Martins were
hawking vigorously, in the vicinity of Penzance, to the
28th of November, as witnessed by Mr E. H. Rodd.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Captain Hadfield again, writing in 1856, gives extracts
from his journals, whereby he records having seen Swallows
and Martins as late as November 3, 1841, December
2, 1842, November 13, 1852, November 22, 1853, November
(about the middle) 1854, and November 24 (Swallows)
and December 2 (Martins) 1855. Of the last-mentioned
occurrence he gives the following interesting note:&mdash;"Dec.
2, 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Observed eight Martins flying round the
garden, and occasionally alighting on the perpendicular
face of the wall of a house near my garden gate, to which
they would cling for a few seconds, and then, dropping
off, whirl round, returning to the same spot, seemingly
quite unconscious of my presence and that of several
others: they seemed bent on effecting an entrance under
the eaves of the house, by a small opening they had discovered
near a water-pipe that had been carried through
the wall: they were, I believe, all young birds of the season,
as they appeared small, their tails being also shorter
than in the adults; they were weak on the wing, but that
may have arisen from their being benumbed by the cold,
the thermometer standing at 44&deg; only at the above hour.
There had been a bright sun during the greater part of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>the day, but I had observed a white frost in the morning.
I conclude that these late birds were merely seeking a
roosting-place for the night, and not a place of concealment
for the winter, although I might have been excused,
according to Cuvier, White, &amp;c., had I thought they were
taking up their winter quarters; but I have not sufficient
faith in the theory to induce me to unslate a part of the
roof to seek for them, which might be done, however, at a
trifling cost, provided permission were obtained."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>It is rather a pity that the observer had not confidence
enough to induce him to make the investigation which he
suggests.</p>

<p>Mr William Bree mentions as many as fifteen or twenty
Martins and Swallows sporting in the air near Temple Balsall
on the 18th November 1846, adding that he has frequently
seen individuals much later, but never recollects
to have seen so great a number together at that late period.
And, finally, Mr J. Johnston, jun., reports that he saw, in
the afternoon of 18th January 1837, three Swallows dipping
and hawking as in summer, near Wakefield.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>There is less evidence of the appearance of these birds
before the ordinary time of arrival of the migrants. But
White, when a boy, observed a Swallow for a whole day
together on a sunny warm Shrove Tuesday, which day
could not fall out later than the middle of March, and
often happened early in February.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> And Mr Samuel
Gurney, jun., together with several other persons, saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>either a Martin or Swallow, on the 27th of March
1844.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>If this last occurrence had stood alone, it would have
been of slight importance; for Yarrell mentions a single
Swallow as having been seen by a fisherman near the
Eddystone as early as the 4th of April; and Sand-martins,
even as far north as Carlisle, before the end of March. It
is just possible that these may have been stragglers of the
great army of migrants, arriving some ten or fifteen days
before their time; but considering the whole great array
of evidence, I rather believe that these too were hybernants,
who had been prematurely awakened from torpidity
by unusually warm days.</p>

<p>The accounts of <i>Hirundines</i> having been found in a
somnolent state in winter may or may not be true;
though the great number of such statements in various
and distant countries makes the indiscriminate rejection
of them even more difficult than the acceptance. But
still there remains the undeniable fact that it is quite an
ordinary thing for birds of this family, including all our
four common species, to be seen with us through November
and December, and occasionally in January;&mdash;that is,
for two or three months after the great body of migrants
have left the country. No one, I suppose, pretends that migration
of Swallows takes place in December or January;
therefore it is manifest that a certain number&mdash;more or
fewer&mdash;remain. What becomes of them? We certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>see them only occasionally: where are they on the days on
which they do not appear,&mdash;days extending to several
consecutive weeks? If they had not been torpid during
those weeks, if the more active functions of life had not
been suspended, would they not certainly have been
starved? But the specimen shot on the 10th December,
and examined by Mr Bell, was in good condition, which
is consistent with but one alternative; either it had been
well fed throughout the preceding six weeks, or it had
been hybernating. But the former supposition implies
that it had been habitually on the wing during that
period, as Swallows feed only on the wing; which could
not have been the case without its being noticed and
recorded.</p>

<p>It is common to say that these occasional winter Swallows
are the later broods of young, which, being too infantile
to migrate, are compelled to linger in the country of
their nativity, and becoming lethargic from the advancing
cold, at length die before the spring. But when this
hypothesis is looked at, it seems hardly tenable. In
many of the instances recorded, the specimens seen even
late into the winter, are represented as gaily and vigorously
hawking for flies, or sweeping over the water as in
summer. This does not look like poor deserted orphans
starved with the cold, retiring to die; but birds in health,
temporarily awakened from normal slumber by an unusual
temperature, and instantly ready for a full use of their
faculties. However, to settle the point by fact, Mr Bell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
distinctly states that his specimen of December 10th was
"an adult bird, <i>not</i> a young bird of the season."</p>

<p>If it should be asked why they do not appear in January
or February, as well as November and December, the
answer is obvious. The winter's lethargy of hybernating
warm-blooded vertebrates is much more readily interrupted
in the earlier part of the season than in the middle and
latter part. And this is natural; for the more intense
cold of January benumbs and suspends the vital functions
far more completely, and the <i>coma</i> so superinduced is
sufficiently deep to resist the counteracting influence of a
few warm days, even though the temperature should be
as high as on those earlier days that awakened them, or
even higher.</p>

<p>The aggregate evidence, then, seems to leave no room for
reasonable doubt, that a certain number of our <i>Hirundinid&aelig;</i>,&mdash;few,
indeed, as compared with the vast migrant
population, but still considerable, looked at <i>per se</i>,&mdash;for
some reason or other, evade the task of a southward flight,
and remain, becoming torpid, occasionally betrayed into a
temporary activity, and resuming their active life, about the
same time, or occasionally a little <i>before</i> the time, of the arrival
of their congeners from abroad. It is, however, desirable
for the absolute settlement of the question, that specimens,
actually discovered in a lethargic condition, should come
under the observation of competent scientific naturalists,
<i>open to conviction</i>, who would leave them <i>in situ</i>, keeping
an eye on them from time to time till the return of warm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
weather in spring. It is not enough to take them into a
warm room, and to shew that they revive in such circumstances:
we want to know positively whether they will be
resuscitated normally and naturally by the vernal warmth,
and come forth spontaneously to sport, and wheel, and
skim, and soar, and stoop, and hawk, and twitter,&mdash;among
their travelled fellows. Who will undertake to decide the
point in this manner? He will have achieved a name in
science.</p>

<h2>THE CRESTED AND WATTLED SNAKE.</h2>


<p>About the middle of the last century there existed in
Amsterdam a Museum of natural history, which, though
accumulated by the zeal and industry of a private individual,
far exceeded in extent and magnificence any collection
then in the world. It had been gathered by
Albert Seba, a wealthy apothecary in the Dutch East
India Company's service, who fortunately published an
elaborate description of its contents. This great work,
"<i>Locupletissimi Rerum Naturalium Thesauri accurata
Descriptio</i>,"&mdash;in four volumes folio, published from 1734
to 1765,&mdash;is even now remarkable for the accuracy and
beauty of its copious engravings, which still are referred to
as authorities, though the descriptions are devoid of scientific
value. Many of these figures and descriptions, about
whose reality no shadow of doubt exists, are those of creatures
which are altogether unknown to modern science,
and some of them are highly curious.</p>

<p>Serpents seem to have been a special hobby of Seba's;
and he has delineated a vast number of species. Among
them are two<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> about which a singular interest hangs.
They are of rather small size; the one pale yellow, marked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>with oval reddish spots, the other reddish, with five green
transverse bands. The head in each case has a horny-pointed
muzzle, and the cheeks are furnished with depending
wattles of a coral-red hue.</p>

<p>From the expressions of wonder with which Seba introduces
his descriptions of these animals, it is evident
that they were no ordinary forms. He does not know
whether to call them Eels or Serpents, the critical characters,
which in our day would instantly determine
this point, being then scarcely heeded. He calls them
"marine," but whether on any other evidence than the
pendent processes of the cheeks, which he calls "fins,"
does not appear. But no fish known to naturalists will
answer to these representations. The pointed head, indeed,
resembles in some respects that of <i>Mur&oelig;na</i>, but
this genus of fishes is altogether destitute of pectoral fins,
while the vertically-flattened tail, and the long dorsal and
anal fins confluent around the extremity of the body in
<i>Mur&oelig;na</i>, are totally unlike these figures. These and all
similar fishes are, moreover, destitute of visible scales;
but in these the scaling is decidedly serpentine, and the
second, in particular, has large symmetrical plates across
the belly, while the head in both is shielded with broad
plates like a Colubrine Snake. The tail is drawn out to
a long conical point, without the slightest appearance of
compression or of bordering fins. In one figure there is
seen a little projecting point at the edge of the lower
belly, which at first sight suggests the idea of the anal
hook of a <i>Boa</i>, but which, by comparison with other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
figures, we discover to be intended to represent the projection
of the pre-anal scale. The very minuteness of this
character makes it valuable: its value was doubtless unheeded
by the artist, who merely drew what he saw; it
is, however, a very decisive mark of distinction between
a serpent and a fish.</p>

<p>Seba records that he had received these Serpents from
the Island of St Domingo. This was at that time a
flourishing French colony, and its natural productions
were far better known to Europe than they now are.
When I visited the neighbouring island of Jamaica in
1845-46, I heard accounts of a wonderful animal occasionally
seen in the eastern districts of the island, which was
reported as a Snake with a cock's comb and wattles, and
which crowed like a cock. A good deal of mystery
attached to this strange Serpent.</p>

<p>It was appropriated to a very remarkable and peculiar
character of scenery:&mdash;A wild mountain-region, formed
of white limestone, abounding in narrow glens, bounded
by abrupt precipices, and permeated by whispering streams
that frequently pour in slender cascades over the rocks.
The limestone rock rises in abrupt terraces, wall above
wall, and its entire surface is most singularly honeycombed,
"as if wrought by a graving tool into rough
diamond-points," alternating with smooth and rounded
holes of various sizes, from that of a hazel-nut upward.
In many of these hollows lie the small land-shells of the
country, bleached perfectly white, like the stone itself, of
the genera <i>Helix</i>, <i>Cyclostoma</i>, <i>Helicina</i>, <i>Cylindrella</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
<i>Achatina</i>, &amp;c., many of them perfect, but many more
in fragments. They exactly resemble fossil shells <i>in situ</i>,
but the species are absolutely identical with those that
crawl over the shrubs and trees in the same region. In
very many cases the dead shells accurately fit the hollows
in the rock, whose interior is impressed with the form
and sculpturing of the shell in <i>intaglio</i>:&mdash;a most curious
and interesting fact, as it points to the very recent formation
of the region, the stone bearing evident tokens of
having been in a plastic condition when the shells were
enveloped in it. Out of the hollows of the rock, their
roots fast grasping the sharp-edged projections and tooth-like
points of stone, and twining through the tortuous
cavities, and insinuating their fibrils into every minute
hollow where water may lodge, grow many tall trees of
various kinds, interlaced with climbers, and hung with
festoons of <i>lianes</i>, that resemble long and twisted cords,
thrown from one to another, or depending from the
branches towards the ground. The noble Agave, or what
we in England call the American Aloe, here throws out
its broad, fleshy, spine-edged leaves, and lifts its tall flower-stalk
loaded with the candelabra-like branches of bloom;
and numerous thick <i>Cacti</i>, some erect and massive, others
whip-like, long and trailing, give a peculiar aspect to the
vegetation. Great tufts of <i>Orchide&oelig;</i>,&mdash;the lovely <i>Broughtonia</i>,
with its thick ovate leaves, and racemes of elegant
crimson flowers, the <i>Brasavola</i>, with long leaves resembling
porcupine-quills in form, and blossoms of virgin
white, the <i>Oncidium</i>, with its yellow and red flowers, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
a score of painted butterflies dancing in every breath, and
many others,&mdash;crowd the forks or droop from the twisted
boughs of the trees.</p>

<p>This formation of honeycombed limestone is full of
caverns, many of which lead into one another in chains,
and which have invested the region with a sort of superstitious
mystery. Runaway slaves and outlaws have
availed themselves of the facilities which its ravines and
inaccessible fastnesses afford, to defy capture; and during
the rebellion of the Maroons, it attained a considerable
notoriety. There is one estate about eight miles from
Kingston, in the immediate vicinity of which the famous
hero, Three-fingered Jack, made his head-quarters. It is a
district of wild torrents and waterfalls of the most romantic
character; "the imagination of no painter of theatrical
spectacles can surpass the wild wonders of the mountain-hold
of the <i>real</i> Three-fingered Jack. Part of the road
by which you ascend the falls is a subterranean passage;
and caverns are entered by simple crevices which seem
mere chinks in the irregular surface of the rock, all which
natural peculiarities account for the mysterious disappearances
which the mountain hero was enabled to enact from
his pursuers."</p>

<p>It was at this spot I first heard reliable tidings of the
strange Crested Snake. A medical gentleman of reputation
informed me that he had seen, in 1829, a serpent of
about four feet in length, but of unwonted thickness, dull
ochry in colour with well-defined dark spots, having on
its head a sort of pyramidal helmet, somewhat lobed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the summit, of a pale red hue. The animal, however, was
dead, and decomposition was already setting in. He informed
me that the negroes of the district were well acquainted
with it; and that they represented it as making
a noise, not unlike the crowing of a cock, and as being
addicted to preying on poultry.</p>

<p>Nor is it in Jamaica alone that the Crested Snake is
known. In the island of St Domingo, whence Seba received
his curious specimens, my friend Mr Hill heard
reports of it. A Spanish gentleman whom he was visiting
in Hayti, told him that he had seen it, and begged
him to note it among the remarkable things of the
country. It was in that far east of the island, known as
the ancient Caciquedom of Higuey, where the Indians
were of a more warlike disposition than their meek
brethren of the centre and west, and where the cruelties
perpetrated upon them by their Spanish invaders reached
such a superhuman pitch of diabolism, that even Las
Casas says he almost feared to repeat them. The limestone
mountains are here of exactly the same description as
those in Jamaica, and the scenery assumes exactly the
same romantic character. My friend's Spanish informant
had seen the serpent with mandibles like a bird,
with a cock's crest, with scarlet lobes or wattles; and
he described its habits,&mdash;perhaps rather from common
fame than from personal observation,&mdash;as a frequenter of
hen-roosts, into which it would thrust its head, and deceive
the young chickens by its imitative physiognomy,
and by its attempts to crow, like their own Chanticleer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
"Il canta como un Gallo;" was the report in Hayti, just
as in Jamaica.</p>

<p>I was much interested in this mysterious reptile, and
mentioned in the public papers my wish to possess a
specimen. A gentleman of the vicinity, Mr Jasper Cargill,
was so desirous to oblige me that he offered a sovereign
for one; but though several persons were prompt
to promise the capture, no example was forthcoming.</p>

<p>After my return from Jamaica, the occurrence of two
specimens found came under the notice of my friend, but
neither of them was preserved. Mr Cargill had informed
him that some years before, when visiting Skibo, in St
George's, an estate of his father's, in descending the mountain-road,
his attention was drawn to a snake of a dark
hue, that erected itself from amid some fragments of
limestone-rock that lay about. It was about <i>four feet
long</i>, and unusually <i>thick-bodied</i>. His surprise was greatly
increased on perceiving that it was <i>crested</i>, and that from
the side of the cheeks depended some <i>red-coloured flaps</i>,
like gills or wattles. After gazing at him intently some
time, with its head well erect, it drew itself in, and disappeared
among the fragmentary rocks.</p>

<p>The son of this gentleman met with another specimen
under the following circumstances, as detailed to me by
my friend:&mdash;"It was, I think, on Easter Eve, the 30th of
March last, [1850,] that some youngsters of the town
came running to tell me of a curious snake, unlike any
snake they had ever seen before, which young Cargill had
shot, when out for a day's sport among the woodlands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
a neighbouring penn. They described it as in all respects
a serpent, but with a very curious shaped head, and with
wattles on each side of its jaws. After taking it in hand
and looking at it, they placed it in a hollow tree, intending
to return for it when they should be coming home, but
they had strolled from the place so far that it was inconvenient
to retrace their steps when wearied with rambling;
but they had lost no time in relating the adventure to me,
knowing it would interest me much, particularly as young
Cargill's father had thought it a snake similar to the one
he had seen at Skibo, in St George's, or to the crested
serpent for a specimen of which, when in St Thomas's
in the East, he had offered the sum of twenty shillings.
The youth that shot the snake fell ill on the following
morning with fever, and could not go back to the woodlands
to seek it, but he sent his younger brother who had
been with him; but although he thought he rediscovered
the tree in which his brother had placed it, he could not
find the snake. He conjectured that the rats had devoured
it in the night. When this adventure was related
to me, another youth, Ulick Ramsay, a godson of mine,
who came with the young Cargills to tell me of their
discovery, informed me that not long previously, he had
seen in the hand of the barrack-master-serjeant at the
barracks in Spanish Town, a curious snake, which he, too,
had shot among the rocks of a little line of eminences
near the railway, about two miles out, called Craigallechie.
It was a serpent with a curious shaped head, and projections
on each side, which he likened to the fins of an eel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
but said they were close up to the jaws. Here are, unquestionably,
two of the same snakes with those of Seba's
Thesaurus, taken near Spanish Town, and both about the
honeycombed rocks that protrude through the plain of
St Catherine's in detached ridges and cones and hummocks,
being points of the greater lines of limestone,
which have been covered by the detritus of the plains, leaving
masses of the under-rocks here and there uncovered.
These are the spots frequented, too, by the <i>Cyclura</i>; and
are continuations of our Red Hills&mdash;a country that so
much resembles the terraced cliffs and red-soil glens of
Higuey.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that I have heard nothing more of this
serpent of renown, this true Basilisk, from that time till
now; though I have no doubt my Jamaica friends, who
had become much interested in the matter, would have
communicated the specimen to me if any one had been
obtained. There is, however, sufficient evidence to assume
the existence of such a form in the greater Antilles,
whether Seba's figures be identical with it or not.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII.</h2>

<h2>THE DOUBTFUL.</h2>


<p>A very curious and unaccountable habit is attributed to
some Reptiles, which, though asserted by many witnesses,
at different times and in distant countries, has not yet
received the general assent of men of science. White of
Selborne, in one of his charming letters to Pennant, has
the following note:&mdash;"Several intelligent folks assure me
that they have seen the Viper open her mouth and admit
her helpless young down her throat on sudden surprises,
just as the female Opossum does her brood into the pouch
under her belly, upon the like emergencies. Yet the London
viper-catchers insist on it, to Mr Barrington, that no
such thing ever happens."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The evidence of the London viper-catchers goes for no
more than it is worth; those whom Mr Barrington applied
to,&mdash;how many and of what experience I know not,&mdash;had
not met with such a case. But negative evidence
is of little weight against positive. At the same time,
others of the same fraternity affirm the fact. There is, as
Mr Martin observes, no physiological reason against the
possibility of the young maintaining life for a brief period
within the stomach of the parent. A swallowed frog has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>been heard, by Mr Bell, to cry several minutes after it
had been swallowed by a snake; and the same excellent
authority has seen another frog leap out of the mouth of
a snake which had swallowed it, taking advantage of the
fact that the latter gaped, as they frequently do, immediately
after taking food.</p>

<p>Mr Martin says he has conversed with several who had
been assured by gamekeepers and gardeners that the
swallowing of the young by vipers had been witnessed by
them.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> And Mr Blyth, a zoologist of established reputation,
observes,&mdash;"I have been informed of this by so many
credible eye-witnesses, that I cannot hesitate in yielding
implicit credence to the fact. One man particularly, on
whose word I fully rely, tells me that he has himself seen
as many as thirteen young vipers thus enter the mouth of
the parent, which he afterwards killed and opened for the
purpose of counting them."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Mr E. Percival, writing to the <i>Zoologist</i>, under date
"64 Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, Oct. 17, 1848," narrates the
following facts:&mdash;"When in Scotland, last autumn, I saw
what at the time satisfied me that vipers really possessed
this faculty, though the evidence was scarcely as conclusive
as might have been wished. Walking along a
sunny road, I saw a viper lying on the parapet. She had
apparently just been killed by a blow from a stick. Five
or six young ones, about four inches long, were wriggling
about their murdered parent, and one was making its way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>out of her mouth, at the time when I approached. Whether
this was the first time the young ones had seen the light,
or whether they were only leaving a place of temporary
refuge, I leave to more experienced observers than myself
to determine."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>This communication brought out the following from
the late Mr John Wolley:&mdash;"Mr Percival's interesting
note (<i>Zool.</i>, 2305) on this subject reminds me of a very
similar anecdote, told me several years ago by a gentleman
who is an accurate observer, and who has had long experience
in all kinds of sports. He one day shot a viper, and
almost immediately afterwards it was surrounded by young
ones, in what appeared to him the most mysterious manner.
But here the grand link was wanting which Mr
Percival has supplied,&mdash;the young ones were not seen to
come out of their mother's mouth. I may be allowed to
mention an anecdote, told me in 1842, by an illiterate
shepherd of Hougham, near Dover: he met me catching
vipers, and, on my entering into conversation with him,
he volunteered&mdash;without any allusion of mine&mdash;to tell this
curious story. One day his father came suddenly upon a
viper surrounded by her young, she opened her mouth and
they all ran down her throat; he killed her, and leaving
her on the ground, propped her mouth open between two
pieces of stick; presently the young ones crawled out:
on the slightest alarm they retreated back again,&mdash;and
this they did repeatedly for several days, during which
time many people came to see it.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The young which White
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>of Selborne cut out of the old female, and which immediately
threw themselves into attitudes of defiance, had probably
not then seen the daylight for the first time. Mr
Bell, in a note in Bennett's edition of White's 'Selborne,'
mentions the wide-spread belief in this alleged habit of
the viper; but appears to consider the fact not proved.
Accounts of similar habits in foreign viviparous snakes,
common report, and, above all, Mr Percival's observation,
leave no doubt on my mind about the matter."</p>

<p>The most recent case on record that I have met with,
is the following, communicated to the <i>Zoologist</i><a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> for last
December, by the Rev. Henry Bond, of South Petherton:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Walking in an orchard near Tyneham House, in
Dorsetshire, I came upon an old adder basking in the
sun, with her young around her; she was lying on some
grass that had been long cut, and had become smooth
and bleached by exposure to the weather. Alarmed by
my approach, I distinctly saw the young ones run down
their mother's throat. At that time I had never heard of
the controversy respecting the fact, otherwise I should
have been more anxious to have killed the adder, to prove
the case. As it was, she escaped while I was more interested
in the circumstance I witnessed than in her destruction."</p>

<p>Exactly the same thing is told of the North American
Rattlesnake. Hunter says, that when alarmed, the young
ones, which are eight or ten in number, retreat into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>mouth of the parent, and reappear on its giving a contractile
muscular token that the danger is past.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>M. Palisot de Beauvois asserts that he saw a large
rattlesnake which he had disturbed in his walks immediately
coil itself up and open its jaws, when in an instant
five small ones that were lying by it rushed into its open
mouth. He concealed himself, and watched the snake,
and in a quarter of an hour saw her discharge them. He
then approached a second time, when the young ones
rushed into the parent's mouth more quickly than before,
and the animal immediately moved off, and escaped.
The phenomenon is said to have been observed in regard
to some of the venomous snakes of India, but I cannot
now refer to details.</p>

<p>Confirmation of a reported fact is sometimes derived
from collateral evidence, and such is not wanting in the
present case. The phenomenon is not confined to serpents;
it has been observed in their near relatives, the
lizards. Mr Edward Newman, while guarding the subject
with a philosophical caveat, furnishes his readers with the
following highly interesting and germane statement:&mdash;"1st,
My late lamented friend, William Christy, jun., found
a fine specimen of the common scaly lizard with two young
ones. Taking an interest in everything relating to Natural
History, he put them into a small pocket vasculum to bring
home; but when he next opened the vasculum the young
ones had disappeared, and the belly of the parent was
greatly distended; he concluded she had devoured her own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>offspring; at night the vasculum was laid on a table, and
the lizard was therefore at rest: in the morning the young
ones had reappeared, and the mother was as lean as at first.
2d, Mr Henry Doubleday, of Epping, supplies the following
information:&mdash;A person whose name is English, a good
observer, and one, as it were, brought up in Natural
History, under Mr Doubleday's tuition, once happened to
set his foot on a lizard in the forest, and while the lizard
was thus held down by his foot, he distinctly saw three
young ones run out of her mouth. Struck by such a
phenomenon, he killed and opened the old one, and found
two other young ones in her stomach, which had been
injured when he trod upon her. In both these instances
the narrators are of that class who do know what to observe,
and how to observe it; and the facts, whatever explanation
they may admit, are not to be dismissed as the
result of imagination or mistaken observation."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>It is remarkable that all the serpents to which the
phenomenon is attributed are ovo-viviparous. Our common
lizard, to which the facts just narrated doubtless
belong (<i>Zootoca vivipara</i>), has the same property, which,
however, appears to be by no means common among the
Saurian races. This coincidence, while it would afford a
handle to the deniers of the stated facts, in the assumption
that the emergence of the living young from the
abdomen, or their presence within it, has given rise to the
notion&mdash;may have an essential significance and connexion
with the phenomenon itself, on the hypothesis of its truth.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>That endowment, whatever it be, which enables the young
to live and breathe in the abdominal cavity of the mother
before birth, may render it easier for them than for others
not so endowed to survive a temporary incarceration within
the stomach after birth. Mr Newman does not know how
to believe that a young and tender animal can remain in
the strongly digestive stomach of a viper and receive no
injury; but he has forgotten to take into the account the
well-ascertained power that living tissues have the power
of resisting the action of chemical re-agents that would
instantly take effect upon them when dead. The walls
of the stomach itself are not corroded by the gastric-juice
which is rapidly dissolving the piece of meat within it.
If the young animals can do without air for a while in
their snug retreat, I do not think they would need fear
the digestive operation. Air, I should suppose, <i>must</i> be
excluded from the stomach, unless the parent have the
power of swallowing air voluntarily, for the emergency;
but perhaps a cold-blooded animal like a reptile, with a sluggish
circulation and respiration, might do with very much
less fresh air than a mammal under similar conditions.</p>

<p>The proposed <i>rationale</i> of those who reject these statements,&mdash;that
female vipers in the last stage of pregnancy
have been opened, and have given freedom to living and
active young, and that careless and unscientific observers
have leaped to the conclusion that their young must have
entered by the mouth,&mdash;will not stand before the testimony
distinctly given by witnesses, who have actually
seen the young retreat into the mouth, and have then found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
them within the body. No doubt the subject needs further
investigation by careful and unprejudiced naturalists;
but the positive evidence already adduced on the testimony
of so many deponents, warrants our accepting the phenomenon
as a normal habit of certain species of Saurians
and Ophidians, though it may be somewhat rarely resorted
to, and that whatever physical difficulties may seem to
stand in the way of its <i>&agrave; priori</i> probability&mdash;difficulties
which perhaps depend on our ignorance, and which will
disappear before the light of advancing knowledge.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The entomologists have fallen most ungallantly foul of
Madame Merian, a lady who resided in Surinam nearly
two hundred years ago, and devoted her attention to the
native entomology, painting insects in a very admirable
manner. She is set down as a thorough heretic, not at all
to be believed, a manufacturer of unsound natural history,
an inventor of false facts in science.</p>

<p>Among other things, she speaks of a large hemipterous
fly, which has in consequence of her reports been named
<i>Fulgora lanternaria</i>. This insect has the head produced
into a large inflated proboscis more than an inch in length,
which is said to carry an intense luminosity within its
transparent walls, as a candle is carried within a lantern.
The fair observer says that the first discovery which she
made of this property caused her no small alarm. The
Indians had brought her several of these insects, which
by daylight exhibited no extraordinary appearance, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
she enclosed them in a box until she should have an
opportunity of drawing them, placing it upon a table in her
lodging-room. In the middle of the night the confined
insects made such a noise as to awake her, and she opened
the box, the inside of which, to her great astonishment,
appeared all in a blaze; and in her fright letting it fall,
she was not less surprised to see each of the insects apparently
on fire. She soon, however, divined the cause of this
unexpected phenomenon, and re-enclosed her brilliant
guests in their place of confinement. She adds that the
light of one of these Fulgor&aelig; is sufficiently bright to read
a newspaper by: and though the tale of her having
drawn one of these insects by its own light is without
foundation, she doubtless might have done so if she had
chosen.</p>

<p>This circumstantial and apparently truthful statement
has brought no small odium on the fair narrator. Other
naturalists who have had opportunities of seeing the insect
in its native regions strongly deny its luminosity.
The inhabitants of Cayenne, according to the French Dictionnaire
d'Histoire Naturelle, aver that it does not shine
at all; and this is confirmed by M. Richard, a naturalist,
who reared the species. The learned and accurate Count
Hoffmansegg states that his insect collector Herr Sieber,
a practised entomologist of thirty years' experience, who
during a sojourn of several years in Brazil took many specimens
of the <i>Fulgora lanternaria</i>, never saw a single one
which was in the slightest degree luminous. There is a
kindred species in China, <i>F. candelaria</i>, very common in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
those glazed boxes of insects which the Chinese sell to
mariners; this also has been supposed to emit light, but
Dr Cantor assures us that he has never observed the least
luminosity in this species.</p>

<p>Thus it would seem that the obloquy which has fallen
upon the ingenious lady is not altogether undeserved, and
that for the sake of a telling story, she has been indeed
"telling a story." But we may imagine her offended
ghost looking round and saying, "All these gentlemen
merely say they have <i>not</i> seen the light; now I say I have:
is there no one who will verify my statement?"</p>

<p>M. Lacordaire,&mdash;an authority on South American insects
second to none, says that he himself indeed never saw
a luminous <i>Fulgora</i> all the time he was collecting in Brazil
and Cayenne, and that most of the inhabitants of the
latter country, when questioned on the subject, denied the
fact, yet <i>that others of the natives as distinctly affirmed
that it is luminous</i>. He asks whether it is not possible
that the light may be confined to one sex, and thus the
conflicting testimony be reconciled; and gives it as his opinion
that the point is rather one which requires more
careful observation, than one which we can consider absolutely
decided.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Again, the Marquis Spinola, in an elaborate paper on
this tribe, published in the Annals of the Entomological
Society of France,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> strenuously contends that the remarkable
development of the frontal portion of the head
in the whole race is luminous. And finally, a friend of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>Mr Wesmael assured him that he had himself seen the
American <i>Fulgora</i> luminous while alive.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>It may help to sustain our faith in the veracity of
Madame Merian, to know that there is some reason for
attributing occasional luminosity to well-known English
insects, of which hundreds, and even thousands, have been
taken without manifesting a trace of the phenomenon. Mr
Spence, in his interesting Letter on Luminous Insects,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
adduces the following evidence:&mdash;Insects "may be luminous
which have not hitherto been suspected of being
so. This seems proved by the following fact: A learned
friend has informed me, that when he was curate of
Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, in 1780, a farmer of that place,
of the name of Simpringham, brought to him a mole-cricket
(<i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>, Latr.), and told him that
one of his people seeing a <i>Jack-o'-lantern</i>, pursued it, and
knocked it down, when it proved to be this insect, and the
identical specimen shewn to him.</p>

<p>"This singular fact, while it renders it probable that
some insects are luminous which no one has imagined to
be so, seems to afford a clue to the, at least, partial explanation
of the very obscure subject of <i>ignes fatui</i>, and
to shew that there is considerable ground for the opinion
long ago maintained by Ray and Willughby, that the
majority of these supposed meteors are no other than
luminous insects. That the large varying lambent flames
mentioned by Beccaria to be very common in some parts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>of Italy, and the luminous globes seen by Dr Shaw cannot
be thus explained, is obvious. These were probably
electrical phenomena; certainly not explosions of phosphuretted
hydrogen, as has been suggested by some, which
must necessarily have been momentary. But that the
<i>ignis fatuus</i> mentioned by Derham as having been seen by
himself, and which he describes as flitting about a thistle,
was, though he seems of a different opinion, no other than
some luminous insect, I have little doubt. Mr Sheppard
informs me that, travelling one night between Stamford
and Grantham on the top of the stage, he observed for
more than ten minutes a very large <i>ignis fatuus</i> in the low
marshy grounds, which had every appearance of being an
insect. The wind was very high: consequently, had it
been a vapour it must have been carried forward in a
direct line; but this was not the case. It had the same
motion as a <i>Tipula</i>, flying upwards and downwards, backwards
and forwards, sometimes appearing as settled, and
sometimes as hovering in the air. Whatever be the true
nature of these meteors, of which so much is said and so
little known, it is singular how few modern instances of
their having been observed are on record. Dr Darwin
declares, that though in the course of a long life he had
been out in the night, and in the places where they are
said to appear, times without number, he had never seen
anything of the kind; and from the silence of other
philosophers of our own times, it should seem that their
experience is similar."</p>

<p>A paper by Mr R Chambers on the subject adduces the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
additional testimony of facts observed by good naturalists,
as Dickson and Curtis the eminent botanists, and Stothard
the painter and entomologist, by his own father Mr
A. Chambers, and by Joseph Simpson, a fisherman living
near Boston, all of which strongly corroborate the probability
that some, at least, of the <i>ignes fatui</i> are produced
by luminous insects.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Mr Main narrates the case
of a farmer who stated that he had pursued a Will-o'-the-wisp,
and coming up with it had knocked it down, when
it proved to be an insect "exactly like a Maggy-long-legs"&mdash;that
is, the common Crane-fly (<i>Tipula oleracea</i>),
the very insect with which Mr Sheppard had compared
the motions of the luminous flame observed by him.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Mr
Spence argues that while gaseous emanations may be a
cause of stationary <i>ignes fatui</i>, the same cause will not
explain those which flit along from place to place; and that
these are probably luminous insects, however rarely they
may have come under the notice of entomologists. "A
very strong argument for the possibility of some flying
insects being occasionally luminous (in England) is afforded
by the facts ... of luminous caterpillars having
been within these few years observed for the first time
since entomology has been attended to, and that by
observers every way competent. If caterpillars so very
common as those of <i>Mamestra oleracea</i> may sometimes,
though so rarely, be luminous, and if, as Dr Boisduval
suggests, and is very probable, this appearance was caused
by disease, it is obvious that flying insects may be also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>occasionally (though seldom) luminous from disease&mdash;a
supposition which will at once explain the rarity of the
occurrence, and the circumstance that insects of such
different genera, and even orders, are said to have exhibited
this phenomenon."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>These highly curious facts should make observers
cautious in strongly denying statements made by others
of phenomena, when they themselves have not been so
fortunate as to witness them, even though they may
think their opportunities to have been as favourable as
those of the <i>soi-disant</i> observer.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>But we have not yet dismissed Madame Merian. If
acquitted of falsehood here, she stands arraigned on a
second charge of similar character.</p>

<p>In most tropical countries there are found hideous hairy
spiders of monstrous size and most repulsive appearance;
short-legged, sombre-hued, ferocious marauders of the
night, that by day lurk in obscure retreats under stones,
or in burrows in the earth.</p>

<p>Guiana produces a formidable species of this sort
(<i>Mygale avicularia</i>), which measures three inches in
length, and whose feet&mdash;though the genus is, as I have
said, comparatively short-limbed&mdash;cover an area some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>eight or ten inches in diameter. Madame Merian has
exquisitely figured the tragical end of a tiny humming-bird,
surprised by one of these monsters on her eggs; the
petite bird overthrown under the fangs of the sprawling
spider, one of whose feet is in the nest. It was on the
authority of this lady that Linn&aelig;us gave the name of
<i>avicularia</i> to the species. Later naturalists have scouted
the whole story. Mr MacLeay, who resided in Cuba, says
that there are indeed there huge spiders, allied to our
garden spider, which make a geometric net, strong enough
to embarrass small birds; but that these do not attempt
to catch such prey, and never molest birds at all. On
the other hand, he avers that the Cuban <i>Mygale</i>, an allied
species to that of Guiana, makes no web, and has no
power of injuring birds. He put this to the test of
experiment; for having maimed a humming-bird, he
thrust it into the <i>Mygale's</i> hole, which, instead of seizing
the victim, retreated as in fear out of his den. This Mr
MacLeay supposes to be conclusive; but a moment's reflection
will shew how equivocal is the evidence. The
spider may not have been hungry; or he may have been
taken aback by the sudden intrusion; or he might not
choose to take prey that he had not stolen upon and
slaughtered <i>suo more</i>; or he may have muttered in the
Arachnidan language,&mdash;</p>

<p>Because a wolf will cower down in the corner of his lair
(even a tiger has been known to do so)&mdash;when a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
suddenly enters his presence, and will manifest the most
abject fear, would it be philosophical to ridicule the tales
told of wolves pursuing and devouring men by night?</p>

<p>M. Langsdorff asked the people of Brazil if the Caranquexeira,
or the great <i>Mygale</i> of that country, fed upon
humming-birds, when they answered him, with bursts of
laughter, that it only gratified its maw with large flies,
ants, bees, wasps, beetles, &amp;c.; an answer which the traveller
verified by his own personal experience.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> If M.
Langsdorff means, which of course he does, that he
learned by personal observation that the spider <i>ordinarily</i>
feeds on insects, that fact is indubitable, and
never has been doubted; but if he means that he had
experience that it eats <i>only</i> such prey, which is the
question at issue, it is plain that this experience proves
no more than that he never witnessed such a fact.</p>

<p>Percival, in his account of Ceylon, observes:&mdash;"There
is an immense spider here, with legs not less than four
inches long, and having the body covered with thick black
hair." This was doubtless the <i>Mygale</i> of the island. "The
webs which it makes are strong enough to entangle and
hold even small birds, which form its usual prey." Alluding
to this statement, Sir Emerson Tennent says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to the stories told of the <i>Mygale</i> catching and
killing birds, I am satisfied, both from inquiry and observation,
that, at least in Ceylon, they are destitute of truth,
and that (unless in the possible case of acute suffering
from hunger) this creature shuns all description of food
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>except soft insects and annelides." And yet he immediately
adds:&mdash;"A lady at Marandan, near Colombo, told
me that she had, on one occasion, seen a little house-lizard
(<i>gecko</i>) seized and devoured by one of these ugly spiders."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Does he not, then, credit his informant? Or are lizards
included in the category of "soft insects and annelides?"</p>

<p>Against this incredulity, resting on no better than
negative evidence, one might adduce collateral proof from
analogy. There <i>are</i> spiders which feed on vertebrate
animals, and there <i>are</i> spiders whose webs catch birds.
The large and beautiful <i>Nephila claripes</i> of tropical
America weaves strong threads of yellow silk in the paths
of the woods, converging to a web quite strong enough to
arrest a bird of weak flight. It must have been a species
allied to this, but certainly, I think, not the same, of which
Dr Walsh speaks in his "Travels in Brazil." "Among the
insects is an enormous spider, which I did not observe
elsewhere. In passing through an opening between some
trees, I felt my head entangled in some obstructions, and
on withdrawing it, my straw hat remained behind. When
I looked up I saw it suspended in the air, entangled in
the meshes of an immense cobweb, which was drawn like
a veil of thick gauze across the opening, and was expanded
from branch to branch of the opposite trees as
large as a sheet ten or twelve feet in diameter. The
whole of this space was covered with spiders of the same
species but different sizes; some of them, when their legs
were expanded, forming a circle of six or seven inches in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>circumference.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> They were particularly distinguished by
bright spots. The cords composing the web were of a glossy
yellow, like the fibres of silkworms, and equally strong."</p>

<p>There is a creature found in the tropical parts of both
hemispheres, called <i>Solpuga</i>, which though not exactly a
spider, is yet so closely allied to that family as to be in
some measure responsible for its misdoings. It is about
as large as the <i>Mygale</i>, and, with sufficient general resemblance
to it to warrant its being popularly considered a
spider, it has much the same habits and appetites. Captain
Hutton, in a most interesting memoir, describes the
details of an Indian species under the name of <i>Galeodes
vorax</i>. Among many other details, he says&mdash;"This species
is extremely voracious, feeding at night upon beetles,
flies, and even large lizards; and sometimes gorging itself
to such a degree as to render it almost unable to move.
A lizard, three inches long, <i>exclusive of tail</i>, was entirely
devoured; the spider sprung at it, and made a seizure
immediately behind the shoulder, never quitting its hold
until the whole was consumed. The poor lizard struggled
violently at first, rolling over and over in its agony, but
the spider kept firm hold, and gradually sawed away with
its double jaws into the very entrails of the victim. The
only parts uneaten were the jaws and part of the skin,
although the lizard was at least five inches long from nose
to extremity of tail. After this meal, the spider remained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>gorged and motionless for about a fortnight, being much
swollen and distended.</p>

<p>"A young sparrow, about half grown, was placed under
a bell-glass with a <i>Galeodes</i>; the moment the luckless
bird moved, the spider seized him by the thigh, which he
speedily sawed off, in spite of the sparrow's fluttering;
and then as the poor bird continued to struggle in pain,
the savage seized him by the throat, and soon put an end
to his sufferings by cutting off the head. It did not, however,
devour the bird, nor any part of it, but seemed satisfied
with having killed it.</p>

<p>"On another occasion, I gave it a large garden-lizard,
which was instantly seized by the middle of the body; the
lizard, finding that it could not shake off its adversary,
turned its head, and bit the <i>Galeodes</i> on the leg, which
obliged it immediately to quit its hold and retreat.</p>

<p>"On another occasion my friend, Dr Baddeley, confined
one of these spiders in a wall-shade with two young musk
rats (<i>Sorex Indicus</i>), both of which were killed by it."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>In an expedition to the Kurruckpoor Hills, south of
Monghyr, Captain Sherwill found upon the summit of
Maruk, a table-topped hill of 1100 feet elevation, several
of the gigantic webs of the Epeira spider, some of which
measured (including the guy-ropes) from ten to twelve feet
in diameter, the reticulated portion being about five feet, in
the centre of which the spider, of a formidable size and very
active, sits waiting for prey. "The webs," he says, "from
their great strength, offered a sensible resistance when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>forcing our way through them. In the web of one of the
spiders we found a bird entangled, and the young spiders,
about eight in number, feeding upon the carcase. The
bird was, with the exception of its legs and beak, entirely
enveloped in the web, and was much decomposed; the
entwined web had completely pinioned the wings of the
bird, so as to render its escape impossible. The bird was
about the size of a field-lark, and was near the centre of
the web; the old spider was about a foot above the bird:
we secured, measured, and bottled him. Its dimensions
were six inches across the legs, and it was armed with a
formidable pair of mandibles."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>It is clear, then, that there is nothing absurd or contrary
to probability in the statement that spiders attack,
overcome, and devour birds. But Madame Merian is here
again favoured with direct witnesses to sustain her good
faith. M. Moreau de Jonn&egrave;s expressly mentions, on his
own authority, that the South American Mygale climbs the
branches of trees to devour the young of humming-birds.
But the most satisfactory statement is made by Mr H.
W. Bates, who has recently returned from the interior of
Brazil after many years spent in studying the entomology
of that vast region. No one will deny his competency as
a witness. "Now I will relate to you," he says, "what I
saw in the month of June 1849, in the neighbourhood of
Cameta. I was attracted by a curious movement of the
large gray-brown Mygale on the trunk of a vast tree: it
was close beneath a deep crevice or chink in the tree,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
across which this species weaves a dense web, open for its
exit and entrance at one end. In the present instance
the lower part of the web was broken, and two pretty
small finches were entangled in its folds; the finch was
about the size of the common siskin of Europe, and I
judged the two to be male and female; one of them was
quite dead, but secured in the broken web; the other
was under the body of the spider, not quite dead, and was
covered in parts with the filthy liquor or saliva exuded by
the monster. I was on my return from a day's excursion
by land at the time, with my boxes full of valuable and
delicate insects, and six miles from my house, and therefore
could not have brought the specimens home, even if
I had wished, which I did not, as the spider was a very
common species, easily to be procured nearer home. The
species I cannot name; I sent several fine specimens,
stuffed, to London, in 1851; it is wholly of a gray-brown
colour, and clothed with coarse pile. Doubtless you will
immediately know the exact species to which I refer.</p>

<p>"If the Mygales did not prey upon vertebrated animals,
I do not see how they could find sufficient subsistence.</p>

<span class="caption">BIRD-EATING SPIDER.</span>
</div>

<p>"On the extensive sandy campos of Santarem, so bare
in vegetation, there are hundreds of the broad slanting
burrows of the large stout species, (that fine one, dark
brown with paler lines down the legs, of which I sent
specimens in 1851.) The campos, I know, from close
research, to be almost destitute of insects, but at the same
time to swarm with small lizards, and some curious ground
finches of the Emberiza group (one of which has a song
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>wonderfully resembling our yellow bunting of England),
besides which, vast numbers of the <i>Caprimulgid&aelig;</i> and
ground doves lay their eggs on the bare ground.</p>

<p>"I believe this species of Mygale feeds on these animals
and their eggs at night. Just at the close of day, when I
have been hurrying home, not liking to be benighted on
the pathless waste, I have surprised these monsters, who
retreated within the mouths of their burrows on my
approach."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<h2>FASCINATION.</h2>


<p>It is a notion of long standing and widely diffused, that
certain predaceous animals have a power, which, however,
they only occasionally exert, of paralysing the creatures
on which they prey, so as utterly to take away the faculty
of flight, and even, in some circumstances, of drawing
them, as if by an irresistible influence, to their known
and dreaded destruction. This fascinating power has
been most generally attributed to serpents, and is supposed
to reside in a peculiar glare and fixity of the eyes,
which appear to mesmerise the victims. If the gaze be
interrupted, <i>on either part</i>, though but for a moment, it
is supposed that the spell is broken. Is there any such
power? or is it merely one of the many myths with which
popular natural history is still burdened, and which it is
the province of real science to explode? Let us gather
together a few of the facts on which the opinion rests.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether I ought to reckon as such the
following statement, for I do not know the value of the
authority on which it rests. It is, however, sufficiently
curious.</p>

<p>Dr Bird, a somewhat appropriate authority in this
case, mentions an incident which happened in America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
"Two boys lighted by chance upon a large black snake;
upon which one of them resolved to ascertain whether the
snake, so celebrated for its powers, could fascinate him.
He advanced a few steps nearer the snake, and made a
stand, steadily looking on him. When the snake observed
him in that situation, he raised his head with a
quick motion, and the lad says, that at that instant there
appeared something to flash in his eyes, which he could
compare to nothing more similar than the rays of light
thrown from a glass or mirror when turned in the sun-shine;
he said it dazzled his eyes; at the same time the
colours appeared very beautiful ... he felt as if he was
in a whirlpool, and that every turn brought him nearer
to the centre. His comrade seeing him approach nearer
to the snake, immediately ran and killed it."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>There is, however, better authority than this for the
belief in serpent-mesmerism. Professor Kalm states of
the Rattlesnake of North America, that it will frequently
lie at the bottom of a tree on which a squirrel is seated.
The snake fixes his eyes upon the little animal, and from that
moment it cannot escape: it begins a doleful outcry, runs
up the tree a little way, comes down again, then goes up,
and afterwards comes still lower. The snake continues at
the bottom of the tree, with its eyes fixed on the squirrel;
and its attention is so entirely taken up, that a person
accidentally approaching may make a considerable noise,
without so much as the snake's turning about. The
squirrel comes lower, and at last leaps down to the snake,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>whose mouth is already wide open for its reception. The
little animal then, with a piteous cry, runs into its jaws
and is swallowed.</p>

<p>Catesby, though he says he never saw the phenomenon
himself, reports the same thing on the testimony of many
witnesses, who all agreed that the animals, particularly
birds and squirrels, no sooner spy the snake than they
skip from spray to spray, hovering and approaching gradually
nearer their enemy, regardless of any other danger;
but with distracted gestures and outcries descend, though
from the top of the loftiest trees, to the mouth of the
snake, who, opening his jaws, takes them in and in an instant
swallows them.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>More recently Acrell tells the same story, as unquestionable.
He declares that as the snake, who is the most indolent
of all serpents, lies under the shade of a tree, opening
his jaws a little, he fixes his brightly-glittering eyes on
any bird or squirrel which is in it. The squirrel, uttering
a mournful and feeble cry, leaps from bough to bough, as
if seeking to escape, but presently, as if struck with the
fascination, he comes down the tree, and flings himself,
with a spring, into the very jaws of his enemy. A mouse,
shut up with a rattlesnake in an iron box, at first sat in
one corner, the snake opposite to it. The reptile fixed its
terrible eye on the little trembler, which at length threw
itself into the mouth of the serpent.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Lawson affirms that <i>he has seen</i> the phenomenon actually
take place with a squirrel and a rattlesnake.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>
<p>I said that the belief is widely spread. We have seen
it in North America; we will now look at it in Africa.</p>

<p>Captain Forbes incidentally mentions a case analogous
to these. Passing through some high grass at Ahomey,
he observed, within an inch of his leg, a small lizard, with
its eyes fixed. It did not move at his approach. At the
same moment a cobra darted at it, and before he could
raise his stick, bore the victim away. The captain naturally
enough was occupied with his own narrow escape,
and simply narrates the facts without comment; but the
fixity of the gaze, and the motionlessness of the lizard,
were not a little remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Mr Ellis, in his charming volume on Madagascar and
the Cape, makes the following observations:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>"In a country abounding, as Africa does, with serpents,
I expected to hear many anecdotes respecting them; and,
conversing on one occasion with Mr Pullen, a farmer who
has lived many years in the country, and seemed to have
paid rather more than usual attention to this species of
reptile, he said he once saw a mouse running in a field,
and that, coming in sight of a snake, though at a considerable
distance, it instantly stopped. The snake fixed its
eye on the mouse, which then crept slowly towards the
snake, and, as it approached nearer, trembled and shrieked
most piteously, but still kept approaching until quite close,
when it seemed to become prostrate, and the snake then
devoured it. On another occasion he had watched a
snake capture a mouse in the same manner; but, as it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>retreating, he followed, and struck it on the back with a
stick, when it opened its mouth, and the mouse escaping,
ran for some distance, then fell down; but after a minute
recovered and ran away. Another time he said he watched
a snake in the water, which had fixed its eye on a frog sitting
amongst the grass on the bank. The frog, though
greatly alarmed, seemed unable to stir, until Mr Pullen
gradually pushed a rush growing near so that it intervened
between the eye of the snake and its intended victim,
when the frog, as if suddenly liberated, darted away. Mr
Pullen's ideas were in accordance with the popular notion,
that the snake has the power of exercising some mesmeric
or other influence through the steady fixing of its eye, and
that whatever intercepts this gaze breaks, as it were, the
charm, and sets the prisoner free."</p>

<p>A most important witness on this matter is Dr Andrew
Smith, the learned zoologist of South Africa, who thus
soberly throws the weight of his own thoroughly competent
and most conclusive personal observations into the affirmative
scale. In his interesting account of the Boomslange,
a serpent of considerable size found in that region, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As this snake, <i>Bucephalus capensis</i>, in our opinion,
is not provided with a poisonous fluid to instil into wounds
which these fangs may inflict, they must consequently be
intended for a purpose different to those which exist in
poisonous reptiles. Their use seems to be to offer obstacles
to the retrogression of animals, such as birds, &amp;c.,
while they are only partially within the mouth; and, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the circumstance of these fangs being directed backwards,
and not admitting of being raised so as to form an angle
with the edge of the jaw, they are well fitted to act as
powerful holders when once they penetrate the skin and
soft parts of the prey which their possessors may be in
the act of swallowing. Without such fangs escapes would
be common; with such, they are rare.</p>

<p>"The natives of South Africa regard the <i>Bucephalus
capensis</i> as poisonous; but in their opinion we cannot
concur, as we have not been able to discover the existence
of any glands manifestly organised for the secretion
of poison. The fangs are enclosed in a soft, pulpy sheath,
the inner surface of which is commonly coated with a thin
glairy secretion. This secretion possibly may have something
acrid and irritating in its qualities, which may, when
it enters a wound, occasion pain and even swelling, but
nothing of greater importance.</p>

<p>"The <i>Bucephalus capensis</i> is generally found upon
trees, to which it resorts for the purpose of catching birds,
upon which it delights to feed. The presence of a specimen
in a tree is generally soon discovered by the birds of
the neighbourhood, who collect around it, and fly to and
fro, uttering the most piercing cries, until some one, more
terror-struck than the rest, actually scans its lips, and,
almost without resistance, becomes a meal for its enemy.
During such a proceeding the snake is generally observed
with its head raised about ten or twelve inches above the
branch round which its body and tail are entwined, with
its mouth open and its neck inflated, as if anxiously en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>deavouring
to increase the terror which it would almost
appear it was aware would sooner or later bring within
its grasp some one of the feathered group.</p>

<p>"Whatever may be said in ridicule of fascination, it is
nevertheless true that birds, and even quadrupeds, are,
under such circumstances, unable to retire from the presence
of certain of their enemies; and, what is even more extraordinary,
unable to resist the propensity to advance from
a situation of actual safety into one of the most imminent
danger. This I have often seen exemplified in the case
of birds and snakes; and I have heard of instances equally
curious, in which antelopes and other quadrupeds have
been so bewildered by the sudden appearance of crocodiles,
and by the grimaces and contortions they practised,
as to be unable to fly or even to move from the
spot towards which they were approaching to seize
them."<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>It may have been the Boomslange to which Le Vaillant
alludes, who says that he saw, on the branch of a tree, a
species of shrike, trembling as if in convulsions; and at
the distance of nearly four feet, on another branch, he
beheld a large species of snake, that was lying with outstretched
neck, and fiery eyes, gazing steadily at the poor
animal. The agony of the bird was so great, that it was
deprived of the power of moving away; and when one of
the party killed the snake, the shrike was found dead upon
the spot, and that entirely from fear; for on examination
it appeared not to have received the slightest wound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
The same traveller informs us, that a short time afterwards
he observed a small mouse, in similar agonising
convulsions, about two yards distant from a snake, whose
eyes were intently fixed upon it; and on frightening away
the reptile, and taking up the mouse, it expired in his
hand.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>In a record, by Mr D. T. Evans, of some experiments
with Venomous Serpents, made at the Zoological Gardens,
mainly with a view to test the efficacy of a reputed remedy
for their bite,&mdash;<i>Simaba cedron</i>&mdash;and which were pursued
with the utmost philosophic care, we find the following
interesting particulars:&mdash;"The attitudes and movements
of the serpent intending to bite were very striking and
beautiful. In the first place, he made, with the posterior
half of his body, a bold curve, having a strong prehensile
'purchase' on the floor of the cage, so as to secure a steady
fulcrum for the rapid dart made at the time of the bite.
The upper half of the body was raised some ten inches or
a foot, the neck strongly arched, and the head, bent at
nearly right angles with the neck, was poised directly
opposite the prey. In such position the serpent remained
a greater or lesser time (sometimes as long as twenty
minutes) according to circumstances. During this interval,
the slightest motion of the animal before him was followed
by an instantaneous and correspondent movement
of the head and neck of the serpent. The purpose seemed
to be that of aim-taking, for the eyes were intently fixed
upon the prey; but I am by no means sure that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
snake, knowing that the latter cannot escape him, does
not derive pleasure from this prolonged and intent gaze.
At all events, in one experiment, where the head of a
rattlesnake so engaged was sideways to the glass of the
cage, and near it, I observed, and called attention to the
fact, a remarkable vermicular motion along the course of
the poison-gland to the opening of the angle of the mouth,
which we thought might afford him pleasure, and this continued
until the snake struck his prey.</p>

<p>"So far the Serpents. I now proceed to describe the
peculiarities shewn by the animals on which we experimented.
Some philosophers have denied innate ideas to
man; these and some others have furthermore denied an
instinctive apprehension of danger in animals. They say
that of itself, as born, the hare has no dread of the hound:
that its fear is acquired of experience. I concur in
neither of these opinions, and think the latter altogether
refuted by the conduct of the animals exposed to serpents
in these experiments. Not one of the guinea-pigs or
rabbits (which were all something under their full growth)
had ever seen a serpent; yet when introduced to the cage
they shewed unequivocal symptoms of distress and fear.
In some instances they actually screamed before they
were struck. They generally shewed restlessness at first,
but when the serpent, intending to strike, poised himself
in front, they became for a time, if not altogether,
motionless. Is there such a thing as 'fascination?' If
by this is meant a pleasurable paralysis of the animal's
powers, I think it more than doubtful; but a deprivation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of the power of motion from terror may, perhaps, take
place. All, however, that I speak to is a perfectly motionless
condition of snake and prey, lasting several
minutes."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Nor are there wanting examples of the same power
exercised by the common Snake of our own country. I
content myself with the following two, both of very recent
record:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Up the hill above Tyneham," writes the Rev. Henry
Bond, last August, "towards the sea, I was struck by the
shrill cry and fluttering agitation of a common hedge-sparrow,
in a whitethorn bush. Regardless of my presence,
its remarkable motions were continued, getting, at
every hop from bough to bough, lower and lower down
in the bush. Drawing nearer, I saw a common snake
coiled up, but having its head erect, watching the sparrow;
the moment the snake saw me it glided away,
and the sparrow flew off with its usual mode of
flight."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>This anecdote brings out another by Mr John Henry
Belfrage, of Muswell Hill:&mdash;"When proceeding down the
avenue here one morning, at a turn in the path I saw a
robin, which appeared to me spell-bound, so much so as
to allow a much closer approach than is usual even with
that boldest of the feathered tribe. On going nearer I
perceived what I took to be the cause, in a large common
snake, which was lying coiled up on one side of the path,
with its head a little raised. My appearance broke the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>spell, and the robin flew away; at the same time, the
snake dropped its head and assumed a perfectly inert
appearance."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Journal of the Indian Archipelago</i>
thus reports the mesmeric faculty exercised upon a certainly
somewhat unlikely subject:&mdash;"On approaching an
almost dry drain, I saw a snake slowly extending his
coils, raising his head, and steadfastly gazing on what I
saw to be an eel of about a foot in length. The eel was
directly opposite to the snake, and glance seemed to meet
glance, when the snake, having the requisite proximity,
darted on the eel and caught it about an inch behind the
head, and carried it off; but the captor was soon himself
a captive, for with a blow on his head I secured
both."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The mystery is, as usual in such cases, attempted to be
explained away. Man does not like mystery; scientific
man least of all: it is humbling to the pride of science to
be obliged to confess that there exists anything unaccountable
to the initiated. Mr W. C. L. Martin thus
"explains" the statements of Dr A. Smith, and all such
accounts:&mdash;"There is nothing mysterious in all this; the
snake does not <i>mesmerise</i> its prey, but merely so terrifies
it as to stupify it; besides, the victim may feel an impulse
similar to that which urges many nervous persons on the
edge of a precipice, or top of a lofty tower, to throw
themselves down headlong, and which we have heard
such describe as resisted with difficulty; so may the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>panic-struck bird feel an impulse to rush into danger
which it might escape by flight."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>And again:&mdash;"Fear, amounting to panic, solicitude for
its young, and efforts to drive away the dreaded intruder,
leading the bird to venture too closely to the snake for
its own safety, produce the results erroneously attributed
to the Reptile's fancied power of fascination by its glance,
or by some mystic property."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Dr Barton, of Philadelphia, who, at the close of the last
century, published a memoir on the fascinating powers
attributed to certain serpents, advocated the same views.
He considered that in almost every instance the supposed
power was exerted on birds at the particular season of
nidification, and that the whole hypothesis originated in
the <span title="Greek: storgê">&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#951;</span> which prompts them to protect their eggs or
young. No doubt <i>some</i> of the instances which have been
reported as examples of fascination are capable of such an
explanation, but surely not all; and the fallacy, here
again, as in so many parallel cases, lies in the advocating of
some theory which will cover a certain number of the facts,
and the ignoring of all such as will not be so accounted
for. Is it to be supposed that Dr A. Smith could not distinguish
between the condition of involuntary paralysis of
the faculties which he says he has <i>often</i> seen, and the insane
boldness of nesting birds? Had the mice, seen by
Mr Pullen, had the frog, young ones to protect? Or the
squirrel mentioned by Kalm? or the mouse seen by Le
Vaillant? or the eel in the drain? But what is the value
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>of a hypothesis,&mdash;so far as its claims to solve this question
are concerned,&mdash;which will not touch these cases? When
Mr Martin denies that there is anything mysterious in
the matter, and in the same sentence admits that "the
victim may feel an impulse to rush into the danger which
it might escape," he just yields the whole point. I venture
to affirm that this <i>is</i> something mysterious, something
totally unaccountable. I ask <i>what</i>, and <i>whence</i>, and
<i>why</i>, this strange impulse that overcomes the first of all
instincts, the prime law of self-preservation?</p>

<p>It does not explain the cause of the phenomenon,
though it possibly helps us to determine its proper seat, to
learn that fascination belongs to other animals besides the
serpent tribes. We shall perhaps not err if we conclude
that the peculiarity resides not in the object, but in the
subject; that it is a mental emotion capable of being excited
by objects having little in common except the death-terror
which they excite. I have no doubt that it is a
phase of extreme terror; the singularity of the phenomenon
consists in the reversal of ordinary instinctive laws
which it induces. My readers will probably be interested
in the details of some cases in which the exciters of the
emotion were animals other than serpents. Here is one,
apparently related with care and truthfulness, though
anonymous, in which the fascinator was as unlikely as can
be well imagined to excite, and the fascinatee to feel, the
emotion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One evening, being seated in a room at Garrackpore,
the window of which was open, and the ceiling on one side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
sloped downwards towards the window, my attention was
attracted by a butterfly which chanced to fly into the room.
I observed its motions for a minute or two, when I thought
there was something that appeared unnatural in them,
and the insect began to dart to and fro in one direction,
occasionally, however, varying its flight about the room.
I looked up to see what it could possibly be at, and instantly
observed an ordinary-sized lizard on the cloth of the
upper ceiling. I had not even then the most distant idea
of what was really going on; but seeing the butterfly dart
every now and then at the lizard, I supposed it in play,
till its motions became less quick and animated. The
lizard remained all this time immovable, but at last suddenly
shifted its ground to the sloping part of the ceiling.
The motions of the butterfly became still more languid,
until at length, to my utter surprise, I saw the lizard open
its mouth, and the butterfly flew directly into it. The
lizard was about half a minute swallowing it, wings and
all. Until the last act of this curious scene, though I well
knew the lizard's object, I supposed it would probably
make a leap at the butterfly, yet had no idea of its succeeding,
and expected to see the butterfly fly away. Had
I had an idea of the cause, I should have broken the charm.</p>

<p>"From that moment I never had the least doubt of the
power of fascination: that power I conceive to be <i>terror</i>,
which, if the object was sufficiently terrible, I believe
would act equally on man or any other creature."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Still more strange is it to hear of scorpions fascinating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>blue-bottle flies! "On my arrival" says Mr Robert
Hunter, "at N&aacute;gpur, in Central India, in 1847, I requested
that the first scorpion found in the house might
be allowed to live for a few minutes, that I might have
an opportunity of observing its form and movements.
In that part of India one has rarely to wait long for such
a visitant, and on an early evening my colleague, the Rev.
Mr Hislop, announced that there was a scorpion on the
wall. A lamp was set down on the floor, and we took
convenient stations for noting what might pass. Just
then a large fly, of the genus Musca, made its appearance,
and soon became aware of the presence of the scorpion.
A strong fury seemed to seize it, irresistibly impelling
it to an insane attack on the terrible occupant of the wall:
it flew at it with all the little force it could muster, the
scorpion meanwhile stretching out its lobster-like claw to
catch it as it came. At the first charge, the fly rebounded
from the crustaceous integument of its adversary, having
done no more damage than if a child were to apply its
hand to the well-mailed body of a cuirassier. It seemed
amazed at its own audacity; and in a state of great
apparent agitation wheeled round, and taking precipitately
to flight, soon put two or three yards of safe space
between itself and its formidable but wingless foe. We
now forcibly hoped 'the better part of valour' might be
allowed to prevail. But no! the tiny creature stood&mdash;it
ventured to look&mdash;there glared still in view the
malignant form. What could the poor animal do but
make a second brilliant onset, in which it again eluded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the outstretched claw of its enemy, and, as before, was
successful in effecting a retreat? 'Surely,' we mused,
'no further knight-errantry will be attempted: the most
exacting would consider this enough.' But we were mistaken.
Again and again did the fly return to the combat,
till in an unguarded moment it flew exactly into the open
claw, which closing, rendered escape impossible. The
generosity of a Mouravieff was scarcely to be looked for
in the scorpion, which, as will be readily believed, lost no
time in devouring its gallant captive. Possibly the fly
may have been partly dazzled by the glare of the lamp.
But undoubtedly it was in the main fascination, induced
by the sight of the dread figure on the wall, that impelled
it to begin the unequal contest, which could terminate
only in the loss of its life."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>After these cases, I fear my readers would see but little
of the romantic in stories of stoats mesmerising hares
and rabbits, or foxes paralysing pullets. The former are
common enough,&mdash;the wretched hare creeping along with
a bewildered look, as if its back were broken, or screaming
in helpless immobility. I will confine myself to a single
narrative furnished by Mr Henry Bond, to whom this
chapter is already indebted for one case. As he was
walking on the hillside above West Creech Farm, in
Penbeck, Somerset, last August, where the down is
scattered with very low furze-bushes, his attention was
arrested by a cry of distress. It proceeded from a rabbit
which was cantering round in a ring, with a halting gait.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>He watched it for some minutes; but, as the circle became
smaller, and the rabbit more agitated, he perceived a stoat
turning its head with the rabbit's motion, and fixing its
gaze upon it. He struck a blow at the stoat, but missed
it; its attention was thus withdrawn from its intended
victim, which instantly ran away with great vigour in a
straight direction.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>This is a remarkably good case; the circular movement
of the rabbit; the ever-diminishing circle; the rotation of
the stoat; the fixity of its gaze; the liberation of the rabbit
the moment the stoat was disturbed; and the instant
recovery of its faculties on the breaking of the spell;&mdash;all
these are circumstances of the highest interest in a case
avouched by so good a naturalist as Mr Bond.</p>

<p>Mr J. H. Gurney reports the account of a respectable
gamekeeper, who, being much annoyed by the nightly
visits of a fox to the poultry, could not imagine how Reynard
managed to effect his purpose, as they roosted on a
large spreading oak. One morning, however, just as day
was dawning, he heard a great noise among the poultry,
and, looking out of the window, saw a fox running round
and round under the place where they sat, and soon observed
that the fowls began to fall from the tree in great
confusion. The fox immediately seized his victim, and
the mystery was so far solved. A day or two afterwards
the fox, a very large male, was killed in an adjoining
paddock, and no further assaults were made upon the
poultry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>In this case the result was possibly effected by vertigo;
the birds, bewildered and amazed in the dim light, followed
with their eyes the course of the sly depredator, as he ran
swiftly in a circle beneath, until the frequent turning of
their heads made them giddy and unable to keep their
balance. <i>But how did the fox know that such a result
would follow?</i></p>

<p>The same gentleman gives, from his own observation,
a case that is more to the point. Here a bird is the
mesmeric practitioner. "I once saw a golden eagle which
appeared entirely to fascinate a rabbit that was put into
the large cage in which the eagle was kept. As soon as
the rabbit was introduced, the eagle fixed his eye upon it,
and the rabbit intently returned the gaze, and began
going round the eagle in circles, approaching nearer each
time, the eagle meanwhile turning on his axis (as it were)
on the block of wood upon which he was seated, and keeping
his eye fixed upon that of the rabbit.</p>

<p>"When the rabbit had approached very near to the
bottom of the eagle's perch, it stood up on its hind
legs, and looked the eagle in the face; the eagle then
made his pounce, which appeared at once to break
the charm, and the rabbit ran for its life, but it was
too late for it to escape the clutch of the eagle, and
the instant death which followed that tremendous
squeeze."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>I am not sure how far a parallelism exists between this
animal fascination by the eye, and that attraction which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>fire is well known to possess for many creatures. Shelley
sings of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The desire of the moth for the star,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as if it were a romantic passion for that which is bright
and beautiful. This is, of course, a poet's aspect; the
insect-collector, who wants to fill his cabinet&mdash;"my friend
the weaver," who nightly pursues his "untaxed and undisputed
game"&mdash;well knows that the glare of his bull's-eye
lamp will attract the moths by thousands on a damp
night in June. The little flitting atoms pass and repass
across the field of light, suddenly flashing into full
radiance, and in an instant relapsing into the darkness,
unless his gauze net is too rapid for them. I have often
sat reading late at night with a candle in the window,
and observed with interest how many insects of all orders
will soon congregate on the outside; now and then some
large moth coming up with a dull <i>thud</i>, or a great mailed
beetle dashing against the glass with a crash that makes
one look sharply up to see whether he has not cracked
the pane. In Jamaica I have taken many valuable
beetles and other insects around the candle-shades at an
open window, which were not met with in any other way.</p>

<p>So in Alabama, where it is customary in balmy autumn
evenings for the family to sit in the yard under the broad
sheltering trees, by the flickering light of the yard-fire.
This fire is lighted at dusk on an iron tripod breast-high,
and kept up till bed-time. It is the duty of a negro
urchin to keep it constantly bright with splints of pine,
so as to maintain a perpetual blaze, as the object is to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
illuminate the yard and its contiguous offices. The little
"nigger" nods, of course, but the loud scolding voice of
master, mistress, or overseer, or any one else, rates him,
and rouses him to duty, as soon as the flame falls. It is
pleasant to sit and watch the effect of the light, either
transmitted through or reflected from the quivering leaves
of the surrounding trees, the blaze now rising brightly
and playing in tongue-like flickering spires, now sinking
and dying to a ruddy glow, then suddenly reviving under
the frightened watchfulness of the sable minister, who
plays the part of vestal virgin at this altar.</p>

<p>Large insects often play around this fire. Beetles
"wheel their drony flight" in buzzing circles round for
a few turns, and are gone; and moths come fluttering
about, and often scorch their plumy wings. I have taken
some very fine Sphinges and other moths thus; and the
only specimen I ever saw of that very curious insect the
Mole-cricket alive (a species distinct from, but very closely
allied to, our European insect) was one that suddenly
dashed into the ashes of the light-stand&mdash;a curious and
interesting circumstance, when connected with the opinion
that I have before alluded to, that the <i>Gryllotalpa
Europ&aelig;a</i> is one of the producers of the <i>Ignis fatuus</i>.</p>

<p>Birds also are attracted by light at night. I have read
of a Titmouse that was seen fluttering around a gas-lamp
in the suburbs of London, and would not be driven away;
it at length made its entrance into the lamp through the
orifice at the bottom, and continued to flit around and
across the jet. In 1832, a Herring-gull struck one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
mullions of the Bell Rock Light-house with such force,
that two of the polished plates of glass, measuring about
two feet square, and a quarter of an inch in thickness,
were shivered to pieces, and scattered over the floor in a
thousand atoms, to the great alarm of the keeper on watch,
and the other inmates of the house, who rushed instantly
to the light-room. The gull was found to measure five
feet between the tips of the wings. In his gullet was a
large herring, and in his throat a piece of plate-glass of
about one inch in length.</p>

<p>Dr Livingstone gives some curious examples of the attractive
power of fire over various creatures in South
Africa, which he attributes to a sort of fascination. "Fire,"
he says, "exercises a fascinating effect on some kinds of
toads. They may be seen rushing into it on the evenings
without ever starting back on feeling pain. Contact with
the hot embers rather increases the energy with which
they strive to gain the hottest parts, and they never cease
their struggles for the centre, even when their juices are
coagulating and their limbs stiffening in the roasting heat.
Various insects also are thus fascinated; but the scorpions
may be seen coming away from the fire in fierce disgust,
and they are so irritated as to inflict at that time their
most painful stings."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX.</h2>

<h2>SERPENT-CHARMING.</h2>


<p>From the day when the solemn doom was pronounced,&mdash;"I
will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
between thy seed and her seed," the serpent-form has
begotten revulsion and dread in the human breast. And
deservedly; for a venomous serpent is a terrible enemy:
the direful venom of sin injected by "that old serpent, the
Devil," is well symbolised by the most potent of all lethic
agencies,&mdash;the poison of the rattlesnake or the cobra.</p>

<p>And yet in all ages there have been persons in the
countries where the most venomous snakes abound, who
have professed, and have been believed to enjoy, an absolute
immunity from their bites, and even to exercise some
inexplicable power over them, whereby their rage is soothed,
and they are rendered for the time gentle and harmless.
The Holy Scriptures repeatedly allude to this ancient art.
The Magicians of Egypt, who turned their rods into serpents,
are supposed to have had recourse to a secret known,
it is said, to the modern conjurors of the same country,
who, by pressing the nape of the neck of the cobra with
their fingers, throw it into a sort of catalepsy, by which
its whole body becomes rigid like a rod, and from which
it is relieved by suddenly throwing it on the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Aaron's rod was a veritable rod before and after the
transaction, but changed into a serpent by Divine miraculous
energy: theirs were serpents made to assume the
appearance of rods for the moment by a cunning device.</p>

<p>Other and more direct allusions, however, occur to the
art of serpent-charming. Thus the obduracy of the
wicked is compared to "the deaf adder that stoppeth her
ear; which will not hearken to the voice of charmers,
charming never so wisely."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> And the Aseverity
of the Chaldean invaders is depicted under this imagery:&mdash;"Behold,
I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you,
which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Among the ancient Romans the Psylli, a people of
Africa, and the Marsi, a German tribe who had settled in
Italy, were reputed to have the power of charming serpents,
and to be endowed with immunity from the results of
their venom. Celsus, however, maintains that this power
consisted in an acquaintance with the fact, now well
known, that animal poisons are hurtful only when mingled
with the blood. They may therefore be taken into the
mouth with perfect impunity. With reference to so great
an authority, however, there is more in the art and
mystery of serpent-charming than this.</p>

<p>When Lucian describes the Babylonian magician as
walking abroad, and calling to him all the serpents that
were near, with certain ceremonies, such as the utterance
of sacred words from an ancient book, lustrations made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>with sulphur and a torch, and solemn marchings in a
circle, and when he asserts that the venomous reptiles,
<i>nolentes volentes</i>, presented themselves harmless at his
feet,&mdash;he describes a scene which is sufficiently familiar
to European travellers in Egypt and India. And so,
when Silius Italicus speaks of Atyr, instructed how to
disarm serpents of their dire venom, and to lull to sleep
the terrible water-snakes with his magic touch, he refers,
whether truly or falsely, to something of a more potent
character than the feat by which Queen Philippa saved
the life of her royal husband.</p>

<p>Immunity from the poison of serpents, and serpent-charming,
are two things. The former, so far as it depends
on the natural law already mentioned, scarcely comes
within the province of this work. But is there not an
innate immunity residing in some persons, and even in
some peoples, by which, without the operation of any
recognised natural law, or even any effort, they are
securely protected either against the bites of venomous
serpents, or, at least, against the fatality which is the
ordinary result of being bitten?</p>

<p>The Psylli, according to Pliny, were so characteristically
endowed with this immunity, that they made it a test
of the legitimacy of their children; for they were accustomed
to expose their new-born babes (only in doubtful
cases, we may suppose) to the most venomous serpents
they could find; assured that if their paternity was pure
Psyllic, they would be quite unharmed. Of this tribe
was the ambassador Hexagon, who, boasting of his power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
before the Roman consuls, submitted to the crucial test
which they suggested, of being inclosed in a vessel
swarming with poisonous reptiles, which, says the legendary
story, hurt him not.</p>

<p>The same historian tells us that the Psylli, who formerly
inhabited the vicinity of the Greater Syrtis,&mdash;that is, the
modern Tripoli and Barca,&mdash;were conquered and almost
exterminated by the Nasamones, who possessed their land;
but that a remnant fled to some distant region. It is not
improbable that the present inhabitants of Sennaar, on
the south of Egypt, may be the lineal descendants of these
same Psylli; for, since Egypt was densely peopled and
highly cultivated, a barbarous tribe could scarcely have
made good their footing there; and as on the other side
was the Great Desert of the S&acirc;hra, and on the north the
sea, there was no resource open to them but to creep
along the desert edge of Egypt till they found a thinly-inhabited
land sufficiently savage to enable them to form
a settlement. The first region of this character that they
could possibly find would be Nubia; and there it is most
interesting to know that there exists a people at the
present time, pretending to the same powers as the old
Psylli. Bruce, whose testimony, at first much impugned,
has come to be received with confidence, avouches that all
the black people in the kingdom of Sennaar, whether
Funge or Nuba, are perfectly armed against the bite of
either scorpion or viper. They take the <i>Cerastes</i>&mdash;a
little asp with two horns, of the most deadly venom&mdash;into
their hands at all times, put them into their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
bosoms, and throw them at one another as children do
balls, without ever irritating them by this usage so much
as to make them bite. One day when the traveller was
sitting with the brother of the prime minister of Sennaar,
a slave of his brought a <i>Cerastes</i>, which he had just taken
out of a hole, and was using with every sort of familiarity.
Bruce expressed his suspicion that the teeth had been
drawn, but was assured that they were not, both by the
slave and by his master, who, taking the viper from him,
wound it round his arm, and at the traveller's desire,
ordered the servant to accompany him with it to his
residence. Here Bruce, to test the power of the serpent,
took a chicken by the neck, and made it flutter; the
seeming indifference of the snake immediately gave place
to eagerness, and he bit the fowl with great signs of anger,
which died almost immediately. Bruce considers that
the indifference was only seeming towards the man,&mdash;that
it was indeed powerlessness, for he constantly observed
that, however lively the snake was before, yet upon being
seized by any of the blacks, it seemed as if taken with
sudden sickness and feebleness, frequently shut its eyes,
and never turned its mouth towards the arm of the person
who held it.</p>

<p>How exactly this account agrees with the words of Silius,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;&mdash; <i>tactuque</i> graves <i>sopire</i> chelydros."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Nubian traveller informs us that the Arabs&mdash;meaning
apparently the Moslem blacks&mdash;have not this
secret naturally, but that from infancy they acquire an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
exemption from the mortal consequences attending the
bites of all venomous reptiles by chewing a certain root,
and washing themselves (it is not <i>anointing</i>) with an infusion
of certain plants in water. This is by no means
improbable; and it were much to be desired that the
root and the plants were obtained and identified, that
their preventive powers might be tested by competent
men of science. In all probability they would be found
to belong to the Quassia tribe, the natural order <i>Simarubace&aelig;</i>,
plants of the tropical regions of both continents,
whose juices are of an intense bitterness. An infusion of
the chips of <i>Quassia amara</i> and of <i>Simaruba amara</i> is
found to be an effectual poison to flies; and the Brazilian
Indians use an infusion of <i>Simaruba versicolor</i> as a
specific against the bite of serpents, and use it with great
effect in the pediculous diseases which are so common
among that people.</p>

<p>It was a plant of this order, <i>Simaba cedron</i>, on which
experiments were made a few years ago, at the Zoological
Gardens, just before the lamentable death, by the bite of
the Cobra, of poor Gurling, who, indeed, assisted in them.
Mr Squire, the eminent chemist, was desirous of testing
the powers of this plant, which, dried and reduced to
powder, is in high repute among the Indians of South
America as a serpentifuge. Dr Quain and Mr Evans
concurred in this desire; and, with the permission of the
Zoological Society of London, a series of experiments, of
much interest, if not very conclusive in their results, were
performed at the Gardens, on the 8th July 1852.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The trials were made only on small animals, but in
each case the alleged remedy proved inefficacious. The
experimenters, however, think that it would be unsafe to
reject the <i>Simaba cedron</i> as an antidote because it here
failed, inasmuch as death followed so rapidly that there
was small opportunity for its action. It is not until it
shall have been tried and have failed upon stronger
animals, that, in the face of the experience of the Indians
in hot climates, it should be repudiated. The remedy
was applied in the form of an infusion poured down the
throat of the bitten animal as quickly as possible after
the stroke, and of the moistened powder applied to the
wound. It seems to me worthy of consideration whether,
in the light of what Bruce says of the Nubians, a washing
of the body with the infusion, or an imbibition of it, or
both, <i>before</i> the serpent's attack, might not be more efficacious
as a preventive either of the bite or of its results,
than its administration afterwards as a cure. Whatever
be the substance with which the Nubians wash themselves,
it seems to communicate to the body some quality, perhaps
of odour, which repels and sickens serpents. Now,
this may reside in the intense bitterness of the <i>Simarubace&aelig;</i>;
and it would be worth while to try whether a
rattlesnake or a puff-adder would strike a guinea-pig that
had just been bathed in an infusion of the <i>Simaba</i>, or to
which a dose of the same had just been administered, and
if so, whether the bite then would be fatal. Even if these
experiments yielded no positive result, it would still be
open to consider whether the lapse of time, or a long sea-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>voyage,
or exposure to our moist climate, may not have
deprived the powdered root of the plant of antitoxic
properties which it may have possessed when freshly prepared
in its native region.</p>

<p>Tschudi, whose researches into the natural history of
Peru are replete with interesting and valuable information,
has some observations on the native remedies for serpent-bites
which I will cite, prefacing the extract with a graphically
terrible picture from his pen of the venomous reptiles
themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The serpents are to be feared; and, on approaching
them, it is not easy to decide at the first view whether
they belong to a poisonous or innoxious species. In the
forests, where the fallen leaves lie in thick moist layers,
the foot of the hunter sinks deep at every step. Multitudes
of venomous Amphibia are hatched in the half-putrescent
vegetable matter; and he who inadvertently
steps on one of these animals may consider himself uncommonly
fortunate if he can effect his retreat without
being wounded. But it is not merely in these places,
which seem assigned by nature for their abode, that loathsome
reptiles are found: they creep between the roots of
large trees, under the thickly-interwoven brushwood, on
the open grass-plats, and in the maize and sugar-cane
fields of the Indians; nay, they crawl even into their huts,
and most fortunate is it for the inhabitants of those districts
that the number of the venomous, compared with
the innoxious reptiles, is comparatively small. Of the
poisonous serpents, only a few kinds are known whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
bite is attended with very dangerous consequences. The
minamaru or jergon (<i>Lachesis picta</i>, Tsch.) is, at most, three
feet long, with a broad, heart-shaped head, and a thick
upper lip. It haunts the higher forests, while in those
lower down his place is filled by his no less fearful relative,
the flammon, (<i>Lachesis rhombeata</i>, Prince Max.,) which is
six or seven feet in length. These serpents are usually
seen coiled almost in a circle, the head thrust forward, and
the fierce, treacherous-looking eyes glaring around, watching
for prey, upon which they pounce with the swiftness
of an arrow; then, coiling themselves up again, they look
tranquilly on the death-struggle of the victim. It would
appear that these Amphibia have a perfect consciousness
of the dreadful effect of their poisonous weapon, for they
use it when they are neither attacked nor threatened, and
they wound not merely animals fit for their food, but all
that come within their reach. More formidable than the
two snakes just described, but happily much less common,
is the brown ten-inch-long viper (<i>Echidna ocellata</i>,
Tsch.). It is brown, with two rows of black circular spots.
The effect of its bite is so rapid that it kills a strong
man in two or three minutes. So convinced are the
natives of its inevitably fatal result, that they never seek
any remedy: but immediately on receiving the wound lay
themselves down to die. In the montanas of Pangoa this
viper abounds more than in any other district: and never
without apprehension do the cholos undertake their annual
journey for the coca harvest, as they fear to fall
victims to the bite of this viper. The warning sound of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the rattle-snake is seldom heard in the hot montanas, and
never in the higher regions.</p>

<p>"Nature, who in almost all things has established an
equilibrium, supplies the natives with remedies against
the bite of the serpent. One of the cures most generally
resorted to is the root of the amarucachu (<i>Polianthes
tuberosa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Linn.), cut into slips and laid upon the wound.
Another is the juice of the creeping plant called vijuco
de huaco (<i>Mikania huaco</i>,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Kunth), which is already very
widely celebrated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p><p>"This latter remedy was discovered by the negroes of
the equatorial province Choco. They remarked that a
sparrow-hawk, called the <i>huaco</i>, picked up snakes for his
principal food, and when bitten by one it flew to the
vejuco and ate some of the leaves. At length the Indians
thought of making the experiment on themselves, and
when bitten by serpents they drank the expressed juice of
the leaves of the vejuco, and constantly found that the
wound was thereby rendered harmless. The use of this
excellent plant soon became general, and in some places
the belief of the preservative power of the vejuco juice
was carried so far that men in good health were inoculated
with it. In this process some spoonfuls of the expressed
fluid are drunk, and afterwards some drops are put into
incisions made in the hands, feet, and breast. The fluid
is rubbed into the wounds by fresh vejuco leaves. After
this operation, according to the testimony of persons
worthy of credit, the bite of the poisonous snake fails for
a long time to have any evil effect. Beside the two plants
mentioned above, many others are used with more or less
favourable results. The inhabitants of the montana also
resort to other means, which are too absurd to be detailed
here: yet these medicines are often of benefit, for their
operation is violently reactive. They usually produce the
effect of repeated emetics and cause great perspiration.
There is much difference in the modes of external treatment
of the wound, and burning is often employed. I saw
an Indian apply to his wife's foot, which had been bitten,
a plaster consisting of moist gunpowder, pulverised
sulphur, and finely-chopped tobacco mixed up together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
He laid this over the wounded part, and set fire to it.
This application in connexion with one of the nausea-exciting
remedies taken inwardly had a successful result.</p>

<p>An English officer, engaged in the wars which freed the
South American republics from the Spanish dominion,
thus speaks of a plant which is probably the same <i>Mikania</i>.
His account is curiously confirmatory of the accuracy
of Bruce:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Among the many medicinal and poisonous plants
growing on the banks of the Orinoco, one of the most
singular is a species of <i>vejuco</i>, which, when properly administered,
proves a powerful preservative from the effects
of poisonous serpents. It even appears to deprive these
reptiles either of their power or inclination to use their
fangs. Some of the leaves and small branches are
pounded, and applied in that state as a cataplasm to both
arms; the skin having been previously scarified freely
above the elbows. This species of inoculation is repeated,
at stated intervals; the juice of the bruised plant, diluted
with water, being also occasionally drunk. Several soldiers,
belonging to General Tedeno's division, had undergone
this treatment, and frequently made the advantage
they had thus acquired useful on a march. They were
thereby enabled to take shelter in deserted huts, which
we dared not enter on account of the snakes always lurking
in such places; although these men could bring them
out in their hands, without sustaining any injury. As
they had been for some time in our company, we could
ascertain that they had not any snakes in their possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
concealed for the purpose of deception. Besides, they
could have little or no inducement to practice an imposition
upon us, as they neither asked for, nor expected, any
reward for exhibiting their skill in destroying these
reptiles."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>According to Captain Forbes, the negroes of Dahomey
employ a grass, or grass-like herb, with success. One of
his hammock-men had been bitten by venomous snakes
repeatedly, but, his father being a doctor, he had escaped
injury. Walking one day through some long grass, the
captain, pointing to the bare legs of his servant, asked if
there was not danger. "None," said he; "my father
picks some grass, and if on the same day the decoction is
applied, the wound heals at once."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Some animals, especially those which prey upon serpents,
seem to be proof against their bites. The Ichneumons
or Mangoustes of Africa and Asia have long been
celebrated for their immunity, and veritable stories have
been narrated of their having recourse to some herb, when
bitten, after which they successfully renewed the attack.
Percival, in his account of Ceylon, relates that a Mangouste
placed in a close room where a venomous serpent was,
instead of darting at it, as he would ordinarily have done,
ran peeping about anxiously seeking some way of escape;
but finding none it returned to its master, crept into his
bosom, and could by no means be persuaded to face the
snake. When, however, both were removed out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>house into the open field, the Mangouste instantly flew at
the serpent, and soon destroyed it. After the combat the
little quadruped suddenly disappeared for a few minutes,
and again returned. Percival concludes, not unreasonably,
that during its absence, it had found the antidotal
herb, and eaten of it. The natives state that the Mangouste
resorts on such occasions to the <i>Ophiorhiza mungos</i>,
whose root is reputed a specific for serpents' bites. This
is a Cinchonaceous plant, so intensely bitter that it is
called by the Malays by a name which signifies earth-gall.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Captain Forbes in his interesting account of Dahomey,
alludes to these combats, which he says he has witnessed
in India. He says that the serpent (Cobra) has usually
the advantage at first, but the Mangouste retreating, devours
some wild herb, returns and presently conquers.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir Emerson Tennent inclines to refer the immunity of
the Mangouste to an inherent property. He remarks that
the mystery of its power has been "referred to the supposition
that there may be some peculiarity in its organisation
which renders it <i>proof against</i> the poison of the
serpent. It remains for future investigation to determine
how far this conjecture is founded in truth; and
whether in the blood of the Mongoos there exists any
element or quality which acts as a prophylactic. Such
exceptional provisions are not without precedent in the
animal economy: the hornbill feeds with impunity on the
deadly fruit of the <i>Strychnos</i>; the milky juice of some
species of <i>Euphorbia</i>, which is harmless to oxen, is invariably
fatal to the zebra; and the tsetse fly, the pest of
South Africa, whose bite is mortal to the ox, the dog,
and the horse, is harmless to man and the untamed creatures
of the forest."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Our own hedgehog possesses the privilege of being unharmed
by the venom of the viper, as is manifest in its
frequent contests with it. Mr Slater has frequently seen
combats between these animals, which always terminated
in favour of the hedgehog. The latter seemed perfectly
regardless of the many bites it received on the snout.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>To return to Bruce's statements. After describing the
little horned viper of Egypt, the <i>Cerastes</i>, and its insidious
manner of creeping towards its victim with its head
averted, till within reach, when it suddenly springs and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>strikes, he goes on to say: "I saw one of them at Cairo
crawl up the side of a box, in which there were many,
and there lie still as if hiding himself, till one of the
people who brought them to us came near him, and
though in a very disadvantageous posture, sticking, as it
were, perpendicularly to the side of the box, he leaped near
the distance of three feet, and fastened between the man's
forefinger and thumb, so as to bring the blood. The fellow
shewed no signs of either pain or fear, and we kept
him with us full four hours, without his applying any
sort of remedy, or seeming inclined to do so.</p>

<p>"To make myself assured" (adds Bruce) "that the animal
was in its perfect state, I made the man hold him by the
neck, so as to force him to open his mouth and lacerate
the thigh of a pelican, a bird I had tamed, as big as a
swan. The bird died in about thirteen minutes, though
it was apparently affected in fifty seconds; and we cannot
think this was a fair trial, because a very few minutes
before it had bit the man, and so discharged part of its
virus, and it was made to scratch the pelican by force,
without any irritation or action of its own.</p>

<span class="caption">SNAKE-CHARMING.</span>
</div>

<p>"I will not hesitate to aver," he adds, "that I have seen
at Cairo (and this may be seen daily without trouble or
expense) a man, who came from above the catacombs,
where the pits of the mummy-birds are kept, who has
taken a Cerastes with his naked hand from a number of
others lying at the bottom of the tub, has put it upon his
bare head, covered it with the common red cap he wears,
then taken it out, put it in his breast, and tied it about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>his neck like a necklace, after which it has been applied
to a hen and bit it, which has died in a few minutes;.
and, to complete the experiment, the man has taken it by
the neck, and beginning at its tail, has ate it, as one
would do a carrot or a stock of celery, without any seeming
repugnance."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>A few years earlier than Bruce, Hasselquist, an enthusiastic
young naturalist, and one of the pupils of Linn&aelig;us,
had visited the East. He paid much attention to the
subject, and records his judgment that there is no delusion
in serpent-charming, but that certain persons do
really, in whatever way they effect it, fascinate serpents.
"They take the most poisonous vipers with their bare
hands, play with them, put them in their bosoms, and
use a great many more tricks with them, as I have often
seen. The person I saw on the above day had only a
small viper, but I have frequently seen them handle those
that are three or four feet long, and of the most horrid
sort. I inquired <i>and examined</i> whether they cut out the
viper's poisonous teeth: but <i>I have seen with my own
eyes they do not</i>: we may therefore conclude, that there
are to this day Psylli in Egypt; but what art they use is
not generally known. Some people are very superstitious;
and the generality believe this to be done by some
supernatural art, which they obtain from invisible beings;
I do not know whether their power is to be ascribed to
good or evil; but I am persuaded that those who undertake
it use many superstitions."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>
<p>Subsequently we find some details of interest. "Now
was the time (July) to catch all sorts of snakes to be met
with in Egypt, the great heats bringing forth these vermin.
I therefore made preparation to get as many as I could,
and at once received four different sorts, which I have
described and preserved in <i>aqua vit&aelig;</i>. These were the
Common Viper, the Cerastes of Alpin, the Jaculus, and
an Anguis Marinus. They were brought me by a Psylle,
who put me, together with the French consul, Sironcourt,
and all the French nation present, in consternation.</p>

<p>"They gathered about us to see how she handled the
most poisonous and dreadful creatures alive and brisk,
without their doing or offering to do her the least harm.
When she put them into the bottle where they were to be
preserved, she took them with her bare hands, and handled
them as our ladies do their laces. She had no difficulty
with any but the <i>Viper&aelig; officinales</i>, which were not fond
of their lodging. They found means to creep out before
the bottle could be corked. They crept over the hands
and bare arms of the woman, without occasioning the
least fear in her; she with great calmness took the snakes
from her body, and put them into the place destined for
their grave. She had taken these serpents in the field
with the same ease she handled them before us; this we
were told by the Arab who brought her to us. Doubtless
this woman had some unknown art which enabled her to
handle those creatures. It was impossible to get any
information from her, for on this subject she would not
open her lips."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>He thus sums up the results of his investigations.
"The circumstances relating to the fascination of serpents
in Egypt stated to me, were principally:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1st.&mdash;That the art is only known to certain families,
who propagate it to their offspring.</p>

<p>"2d.&mdash;The person who knows how to fascinate serpents,
never meddles with other poisonous animals; such as
scorpions, &amp;c. There are different persons who know how
to fascinate these animals; and they again never meddle
with serpents.</p>

<p>"3d.&mdash;Those that fascinate serpents eat them both raw
and boiled, and even make broth of them, which they eat
very commonly amongst them; but in particular they eat
such a dish when they go out to catch them. I have been
told that serpents, fried or boiled, are frequently eaten by
the Arabians, both in Egypt and Arabia, though they
know not how to fascinate them, but catch them either
alive or dead.</p>

<p>"4th.&mdash;After they have eaten their soup, they procure
a blessing from their scheik, who uses some superstitious
ceremonies, and, amongst others, spits on them several
times with certain gestures."</p>

<p>The blessing of the priest, Hasselquist pronounces correctly
enough to be mere superstition; we may fairly
conclude that the eating of the snakes is also irrelevant,&mdash;both
of these circumstances being calculated to increase
popular wonder only, and to lead the observers from the
true scent, which probably is the employment of preventive
simples. Hasselquist had been told of a plant with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
which the charmers anointed or rubbed themselves before
they touched the serpents; but, as no such plant was produced
to him, he regarded it as fabulous. We have seen
reason, however, to conclude that the real key to the
mystery lies there.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>The ancients believed that the human spittle was so
fatal to serpents that much of the secret of charming lay
in the knowledge of this fact. Of course this would
make Psylli of all men; but there may be this measure of
truth in the supposition, that the natural exudations of a
human body which has been bathed or rubbed with a
penetrating alexipharmic, may be so impregnated with the
odour, as to be peculiarly repellent of the snake. Denham
describes a scene of snake-charming in which the spittle
played an important part. A juggler brought him in a
bag two venomous snakes, which he set at liberty, beginning
to beat a little drum. They immediately reared
themselves on their tails, moving in a sort of dance. The
juggler played various tricks with them, sometimes
wreathing them round his neck, coiling them in his
bosom, or throwing them among the people. On
pointing his finger at their mouth, they immediately
raised themselves in attitude to spring forward and
strike; but after having exasperated them to the utmost,
<i>he had only to spit in their face</i>, to make them retreat
quite crest-fallen. From his description these seem to
have been of the genus <i>Naia</i>, upwards of six feet long,
and very venomous. The fangs, he says, had been ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>tracted;
but still, to guard against all possible injury, the
fellow who played tricks with them had a large roll of
cloth wound round the right arm.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The influence of music on the serpents seems to be
universally assumed as a part of the professional snake-charmer's
success. The ancient Psylli who were employed
to prevent the Roman camp from being troubled with
venomous serpents, marched around it, chanting mystic
songs.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Johnson describes the very clever snake-catchers
of India as pretending to draw them from their holes by
a song, and by playing a plaintive tune on an instrument
somewhat resembling an Irish bagpipe.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> He says, indeed,
that this is all delusion; but Forbes, in his "Oriental Memoirs,"
allows its reality. A learned native of India
assured Sir William Jones that he had frequently seen
the most venomous and malignant snakes leave their holes
upon hearing notes from a flute, which, as he supposed,
gave them peculiar delight.</p>

<p>The Egyptian snake-charmer assumes an air of mystery,
strikes the walls with a short palm-stick, whistles, makes a
clucking noise with his tongue, and says, "I adjure you,
by God, if ye be above, or if ye be below, that ye come
forth; I adjure you by the most great Name, if ye be
obedient, come forth, and if ye be disobedient, die, die,
die!"<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The late Dr W. A. Bromfield, in some extracts
from his letters published in the <i>Zoologist</i>,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> confirms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>this:&mdash;"The chief actor was a fine-looking man, with a
handsome and intelligent, but peculiar cast of countenance.
He carried a stick in his hand, with which, on
entering each apartment, he struck the wall several times,
uttering, in a low, measured tone, a form of exorcism in
Arabic; adjuring and commanding the serpent&mdash;which
he declared, immediately on the door being thrown open,
was lurking in the walls or ceiling&mdash;to come forth. Presently,
the reptile would be seen emerging from some hole
or corner, with which every room, even in the better class
of Egyptian houses, abounds; on which the enchanter
would draw the unwilling serpent towards him, with the
point of the stick, and when within reach put it in the
bag he carried about with him for that purpose."</p>

<p>Chateaubriand has drawn a graphic picture of the
power of music on the American Rattlesnake. The
serpent happening to enter the encampment of his
party in Canada, a Canadian who could play on the
flute, advanced, by way of diversion, with his magic
pipe, against it. On his approach the haughty reptile
curled itself into a spiral line, flattened its head, inflated
its cheeks, contracted its lips, displayed its envenomed
fangs, and its bloody throat; its double tongue glowed
like two flames of fire; its eyes were burning coals; its
body, swollen with rage, rose and fell like the bellows of a
forge; its dilated skin assumed a dull and scaly appearance;
and its rattle, which sounded the denunciation of
death, vibrated with extreme velocity. The Canadian
now began to play upon his flute: the serpent started<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
with surprise, and drew back its head. In proportion as
it was struck with the magic effect, its eyes lost their
fierceness, the vibrations of its tail became slower, and the
sound which it emitted gradually became weaker and
ceased. The folds of the fascinated Serpent became less
perpendicular upon their spiral line, expanded by degrees,
and sunk one after another upon the ground, forming
concentric circles. The colours recovered their brilliancy
on its quivering skin; and, slightly turning its head, it
remained motionless in the attitude of attention and
pleasure. At this moment, the Canadian advanced a few
steps, producing with his flute sweet and simple notes.
The Reptile inclined its variegated neck, opened a passage
with its head through the high grass, and began to creep
after the musician, stopping when he stopped, and following
him again as soon as he moved forward. In this
manner, to the astonishment both of Europeans and
natives, he was led out of the camp; and it was unanimously
decreed, that the life of a creature so sensible of
the concord of sweet sounds should be spared.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Some allowance in the colouring of this picture, which
must be allowed to be beautifully painted, may possibly
be made to the poetical imagination of the narrator, for
Chateaubriand could not tell a story without embellishing
it <i>suo more</i>. We may, however, accept the main facts,
confirmed as they are by the experience of other observers
in other countries.</p>

<p>Mr Gogerly, a missionary of some standing in India
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>observes that some persons who were incredulous on the
subject, after taking the most careful precautions against
any trick or artifice being played, sent a charmer into the
garden to prove his powers;&mdash;the man began to play upon
his pipe, and proceeding from one part of the garden to
another, for some minutes stopped at a part of the wall
much injured by age, and intimated that a serpent was
within. He then played quicker, and his notes were louder,
when almost immediately a large Cobra di Capello
put forth its hooded head, and the man ran fearlessly to
the spot, seized it by the throat, and drew it forth. He
then shewed the poison fangs, and beat them out; afterwards
it was taken to the room where his baskets were
left, and deposited among the rest. The snake-charmer,
observes the same writer, applies his pipe to his mouth,
and sends forth a few of his peculiar notes, and all the
serpents stop as though enchanted; they then turn towards
the musician, and approaching him within two feet raise
their heads from the ground, and bending backwards and
forwards, keep time with the tune. When he ceases playing,
they drop their heads and remain quiet on the ground.</p>

<p>The <i>Penny Magazine</i> for April 1833, contains the
following very precise and circumstantial narrative, communicated
by a gentleman of high station at Madras:&mdash;"One
morning, as I sat at breakfast, I heard a loud noise
and shouting among my palankeen-bearers. On inquiry,
I learned that they had seen a large hooded snake, and
were trying to kill it. I immediately went out, and saw
the snake creeping up a very high green mound, whence it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
escaped into a hole in an old wall of ancient fortification;
the men were armed with their sticks, which they always
carry in their hands, and had attempted in vain to kill
the reptile, which had eluded their pursuit, and in his
hole had coiled himself up secure, whilst we could see his
bright eyes shining. I had often desired to ascertain the
truth of the report, as to the effect of music upon snakes.
I therefore inquired for a snake-catcher. I was told there
was no person of the kind in the village; but after a little
inquiry, I heard there was one in a village distant about
three miles. I accordingly sent for him, keeping a strict
watch over the snake, which never attempted to escape,
whilst we, his enemies, were in sight. About an hour
elapsed, when my messenger returned bringing a snake-catcher.
This man wore no covering on his head, nor
any on his person, excepting a small piece of cloth round
his loins; he had in his hands two baskets, one containing
tame snakes, the other empty: these and his musical pipe
were the only things he had with him. I made the snake-catcher
leave his two baskets on the ground, at some distance,
while he ascended the mound with his pipe alone.
He began to play: at the sound of the music the snake
came gradually and slowly out of his hole. When he was
entirely within reach, the snake-catcher seized him dexterously
by the tail and held him thus at arm's length;
whilst the snake, enraged, darted his head in all directions,
but in vain: thus suspended, he has not the power to
round himself, so as to seize hold of his tormentor. He
exhausted himself in vain exertions; when the snake-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>catcher
descended the bank, dropped him into the empty
basket, and closed the lid: he then began to play, and
after a short time, raised the lid of the basket; the snake
darted about wildly, and attempted to escape; the lid was
shut down again quickly, the music always playing. This
was repeated two or three times; and in a very short interval,
the lid being raised, the snake sat on his tail, opened
his hood and danced quite as quietly as the tame snakes
in the other basket, nor did he attempt again to escape.
This, having witnessed with my own eyes, I can assert as
a fact."</p>

<p>Experienced and skilful as these men are, however, they
do not invariably escape with impunity. Fatal terminations
to these exhibitions of the psyllic art now and then
occur, for there are still to be found "deaf adders, which
will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never
so wisely." In Madras, a few years ago, a noted serpent-charmer
chanced one morning to get hold of a Cobra of
considerable size, which he got conveyed to his home.
He was occupied abroad all day, and had not time to get
the dangerous fangs extracted from the Serpent's mouth.
This at least is the probable solution of the matter. In
the evening he returned to his dwelling, considerably
excited with liquor, and began to exhibit tricks with his
snakes to various persons who were around him at the
time. The newly-caught Cobra was brought out with
the others, and the man, spirit-valiant, commenced to
handle the stranger like the rest. But the Cobra darted
at his chin, and bit it, making two marks like pin points.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
The poor juggler was sobered in an instant. "I am a
dead man," he exclaimed. The prospect of immediate
death made the maintenance of his professional mysticism
a thing of no moment. "Let the creature alone,"
said he to those about him, who would have killed the
Cobra; "it may be of service to others who are of my
trade. To me it can be of no more use. Nothing can save
me." His professional knowledge was but too accurate.
In two hours he was a corpse! The narrator saw him a
short time after he died. His friends and brother jugglers
had gathered around him, and had him placed on a
chair in a sitting position. Seeing the detriment likely
to result to their trade and interests from such a notion,
they vehemently asserted that it was not the envenomed
bite which had killed him. "No, no; he only forgot one
little word&mdash;one small portion of the charm." In fact, they
declared that he was not dead at all, but only in a sort of
swoon, from which, according to the rules of the cabalistic
art, he would recover in seven days. But the officers of
the barracks, close to which the deceased had lived, interfered
in the matter. They put a guard of one or two men
on the house, declaring that they would allow the body to
remain unburied for seven days, but would not permit any
trickery. Of course the poor serpent-charmer never came
to life again. His death, and the manner of it, gave a
severe blow, as has been already hinted, to the art and
practice of snake-charming in Madras.</p>

<p>Roberts also mentions the instance of a man who came
to a gentleman's house to exhibit tame snakes, and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
being told that a Cobra, or Hooded Snake was in a cage
in the house, was asked if he could charm it; on his replying
in the affirmative, the Serpent was released from
the cage, and, no doubt, in a state of high irritation. The
man began his incantations, and repeated his charms, but
the Snake darted at him, fastened upon his arm, and before
night he was a corpse.</p>

<p>These failures, rare and abnormal as they confessedly
are, do not by any means disprove the reality of snake-charming;
they certainly shew that the men believe in
their own powers. It may be, as some Europeans have
maintained, that in India, the exhibitors usually practise
upon tame snakes, from which they have already extracted
the fangs, or even eradicated the poison sacs,&mdash;an operation
performed without difficulty by making an incision
beneath and behind each eye. Or it may be that the
power of music over these reptiles is ordinarily relied on,
and that in rare instances this fails. I have myself taken
fierce and active lizards, in Jamaica, by a noose of string,
while whistling a lively tune. As soon as the whistling
commenced, the lizard would become still on the trunk or
the branch of a tree, and so remain unmoved, with a sleepy
look all the while I was searching up the string, preparing
the noose, and presenting it to him, giving just a backward
glance of his eye, as the noose slipped over his head, the
whistling going on vigorously all the time, of course, till
the cord being jerked tight, he suddenly found himself
dangling in the air at the end of a stick, and began to
wriggle and writhe, and scratch and bite furiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing seems clear from these accidents. The
Indian <i>samp-wallahs</i> do not use any infusion or unguent
to stupefy and disarm their snakes, as do those of Ethiopia.
If these men just mentioned had been so protected
they would not have been killed, however rash or pot-valiant
they might have been. Indeed the accounts of
Bruce and others of the African professors of the psyllic
art, and the phenomena of the serpents acted upon, differ
greatly from descriptions of parallel exhibitions in India,
and suggest diverse modes of explanation.</p>

<p>A dozen years ago there were a couple of oriental
Psylli performing at the Zoological Gardens. Mr Brodcrip
has given a very graphic sketch of their performance
as he saw it in the Reptile House. The two Arabs took
up their position on the floor, the company standing in a
semicircle at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>"The old Arab said something to the young one, who
stooped down ... and took out a large deal-box, drew
off the cover, thrust in his hand and pulled out a large
long <i>Naia haje</i> (the Egyptian species of Cobra). After
handling it and playing with it a little while, he set it
down on the floor, half squatted close to it, and fixed his
eyes on the snake. The serpent instantly raised itself,
expanded its hood, and turned slowly on its own axis,
following the eye of the young Arab, turning as his head,
or eye, or body turned. Sometimes it would dart at him,
as if to bite. He exercised the most perfect command
over the animal. All this time the old Arab stood still,
pensively regarding the operation; but presently he also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
squatted down, muttering some words, opposite to the
snake. He evidently affected the reptile more strongly
than his more mercurial relative, though he remained motionless,
doing nothing that I could see but fixing his eyes
upon the snake, with his face upon a level with the raised
head of the serpent, which now turned all its attention to
him, and seemed to be in a paroxysm of rage. Suddenly
it darted open-mouthed at his face, furiously dashing its
expanded whitish-edged jaws into the dark hollow cheek
of the charmer, who still imperturbably kept his position,
only smiling bitterly at his excited antagonist. I was very
close, and watched very narrowly; but though the snake
dashed at the old Arab's face and into it more than twice
or thrice with its mouth wide open, I could not see the
projection of any fang.</p>

<p>"Then the old Arab, who, it was said, had had the gift
of charming serpents in his family for a long series of
years, opened another box, and took out four or five great
lizards, and provoked the Naia with them, holding them
by the tails in a sort of four-in-hand style. Then the youth
brought out a Cerastes, which I observed seemed overpowered,
as if, as the country people say, something had
come over it. He placed it on the floor; but this serpent
did not raise itself like the Naia, but, as the charmer
stooped to it, moved in a very odd, agitated manner, on
its belly, regarding him askant. I thought the serpent
was going to fly at the lad, but it did not. He took it up,
played with it, blew or spit at it, and then set it down apparently
sick, subdued, and limp. He then took it again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
played with it a second time, gathered it up in his hand,
put it in his bosom, went to another box, drew the lid,
and brought out more snakes, one of which was another
Naia, and the others of a most venomous kind.</p>

<p>"Now there were two Naias, with heads and bodies erect,
obeying, apparently, the volition of the charmers. One of
the snakes bit the youth on the naked hand, and brought
blood; but he only spat on the wound and scratched it
with his nail which made the blood flow more freely.
Then he brought out more lizards of a most revolting
aspect. By this time the floor of the reptile house, that
formed the stage of the charmers, began to put one in
mind of the incantation-scene in <i>Der Freischutz</i>, only
that the principal performers looked more like the Black
Huntsman and one of his familiars than Max and Caspar,
and the enchanters' circle was surrounded with fair ladies
and their well-dressed lords, instead of the appalling
shapes which thronged round the affrighted huntsman at
the casting of the charmed bullets.</p>

<p>"The Arabs, holding the snakes by the tails, let their
bodies touch the floor, when they came twisting and
wriggling on towards the spectators, who now backed a
little upon the toes of those who pressed them from behind.
Sometimes the charmers would loose their hold, when the
serpents, as if eager to escape from their tormentors,
rapidly advanced upon the retreating ring; but they
always caught them by the tails in time, and then made
them repeat the same advances. I kept my position in
front throughout, and had no fear, feeling certain that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Mr Mitchell, and those under whose superintendence this
highly amusing and instructive establishment is so well
conducted, would not have permitted the exhibition to take
place, if there had been the least danger. Besides this, I
observed that the charmers only used their own serpents,
which they had, I presume, brought with them; and I confess
that the impression upon my mind was, that they had
been rendered innoxious by mechanical means."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>This last assumption the narrator subsequently found
to be indubitably true. What is said of the <i>Cerastes</i>,
however, looks more like the effect of something detrimental
to the snake in the lad's odour, or in his spittle.
Of course no confidence can be placed in their statements,
but it is noteworthy that they both claimed to belong to
a race over whom snakes have no morbific power,&mdash;Psylli,
in fact, of many generations.</p>

<p>Dr Davy asserts that in India, however, the poison
fangs are <i>not</i> extracted. He tells us that he has himself
examined the snakes exhibited (which are always Cobras)
and have found the fangs uninjured. He attributes the
power of the charmers to their agility and courage,
founded on an intimate acquaintance with the habits and
disposition of the reptiles. The learned Doctor acting on
this persuasion, says that he has himself repeatedly irritated
these serpents with impunity. They can be readily
appeased when irritated, by the voice and by gentle movements
of the hand in a circle, and by stroking them on the
body.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
<p>A very curious subject, closely connected with serpent-charming,
is the power of extracting venom from a wound
inflicted by reptiles, attributed to the "snake-stone," which
the Hindoos and Cingalese usually carry with them.
Captain Napier thus describes it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These people generally have for sale numbers of
<i>snake-stones</i>, which are said to be equally an antidote
against the bite of the serpent and the sting of the scorpion.
For the former I have never seen it tried: and to
prove its efficacy with the latter, the samp-wallah generally
carries about in small earthen vessels a number of
these animals, one of which he allows to wound him with
his sting. The snake-stone, which is a dark, shining,
smooth pebble, about the size and shape of a French
bean, on being applied to the wound, instantly adheres
to it, and by a power of suction appears to draw out
the poison, which is supposed to be contained in the
small bubbles which, on the immersion of the stone into
a glass of water are seen in great numbers to rise to
the surface.</p>

<p>"My first idea on beholding the samp-wallah allow
himself to be stung by the scorpion was that the latter
had by some means been rendered harmless. However,
not wishing voluntarily to put this to the test by personal
experience, I purchased some of the stones, resolved on
the very first opportunity to try their efficacy. Shortly
after this, happening to be marching up the country with
a detachment, we pitched our camp on some very stony
ground, in clearing which one of the English soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
happened to be bit [stung] in the hand by a large
scorpion. As soon as I heard of this circumstance,
I sent for the sufferer, who appeared to be in great
pain, which he described as a burning sensation running
all the way up his arm to the very shoulder.</p>

<p>"I applied one of the snake-stones to the puncture;
it adhered immediately, and during about eight minutes
that it remained on the patient, he by degrees became
easier; the pain diminished, gradually coming down from
the shoulder, until it appeared entirely confined to the
immediate vicinity of the wound. I now removed the
stone; on putting it into a cup of water, numbers of
small air-bubbles rose to the surface, and in a short time
the man ceased to suffer any inconvenience from the
accident."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>It is scarcely needful to say that the emission of bubbles
is a most ordinary phenomenon, and could have not the
slightest connexion with the alexipharmic power of the
stone, whether real or imaginary. Any one may see
exactly the same thing on dropping a bit of new flower-pot,
or a very dry brick into water, or any other substance
heavier than the fluid, which is at the same time dry and
porous. It results from the air which is contained in the
pores of the material, which on immersion is displaced by
the heavier water, and rises in oozing bubbles to the surface.</p>

<p>Sir Emerson Tennent has some observations of much
value on these "stones," as well as on cognate matters,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>which my readers may like to see, and with which I close
this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On one occasion, in March 1854, a friend of mine
was riding, with some other civil officers of the government,
along a jungle-path in the vicinity of Bintenne,
when they saw one of two Tamils, who were approaching
them, suddenly dart into the forest and return, holding in
both hands a <i>cobra di capello</i> which he had seized by the
head and tail. He called to his companion for assistance
to place it in their covered basket, but in doing this, he
handled it so inexpertly that it seized him by the finger,
and retained its hold for a few seconds, as if unable to
retract its fangs. The blood flowed, and intense pain
appeared to follow almost immediately; but, with all
expedition, the friend of the sufferer undid his waistcloth,
and took from it two snake-stones, each of the size of a
small almond, intensely black and highly polished, though
of an extremely light substance. These he applied one to
each wound inflicted by the teeth of the serpent, to which
the stones attached themselves closely, the blood that
oozed from the bites being rapidly imbibed by the porous
texture of the article applied. The stones adhered tenaciously
for three or four minutes, the wounded man's
companion in the meanwhile rubbing his arm downwards
from the shoulder towards the fingers. At length the
snake-stones dropped off of their own accord; the suffering
appeared to have subsided; he twisted his fingers till
the joints cracked, and went on his way without concern.
Whilst this had been going on, another Indian of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
party who had come up took from his bag a small piece
of white wood, which resembled a root, and passed it
gently near the head of the cobra, which the latter immediately
inclined close to the ground; he then lifted the
snake without hesitation, and coiled it into a circle at the
bottom of his basket. The root, by which he professed to
be enabled to perform this operation with safety, he called
the <i>Naya-thalee Kalinga</i> (the root of the snake-plant,)
protected by which he professed his ability to approach
any reptile with impunity. In another instance, in 1853,
Mr Lavalliere, the District Judge of Kandy, informed me
that he saw a snake-charmer in the jungle, close by the
town, search for a <i>cobra di capello</i>, and, after disturbing it
in its retreat, the man tried to secure it, but, in the attempt,
he was bitten in the thigh till blood trickled from the
wound. He instantly applied the <i>Pamboo-Kaloo</i> (or snake-stone),
which adhered closely for about ten minutes, during
which time he passed the root which he held in his hand
backwards and forwards above the stone, till the latter
dropped to the ground. He assured Mr Lavalliere that
all danger was then past. That gentleman obtained from
him the snake-stone he had relied on, and saw him repeatedly
afterwards in perfect health. The substances which
were used on both these occasions are now in my possession.
The roots employed by the several parties are not
identical. One appears to be a bit of the stem of an
<i>Aristolochia</i>; the other is so dry as to render it difficult
to identify it, but it resembles the quadrangular stem of a
jungle vine. Some species of <i>Aristolochia</i>, such as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
<i>A. serpentaria</i> of North America, are supposed to act as
a specific in the cure of snake-bites; and the <i>A. Indica</i>
is the plant to which the ichneumon is popularly believed
to resort as an antidote when bitten; but it is probable
that the use of any particular plant by the snake-charmers
is a pretence, or rather a delusion, the reptile being overpowered
by the resolute action of the operator, and not
by the influence of any secondary appliance, the confidence
inspired by the supposed talisman enabling its possessor
to address himself fearlessly to his task, and thus to effect
by determination and will, what is popularly believed to
be the result of charms and stupefaction."</p>

<p>The writer then alludes to the facts mentioned by
Bruce, which I have before adduced; and proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to the snake-stone itself, I submitted one, the application
of which I have been describing, to Mr Faraday,
and he has communicated to me, as the result of his
analysis, his belief that it is 'a piece of charred bone
which has been filled with blood perhaps several times,
and then carefully charred again. Evidence of this is
afforded, as well by the apertures of cells or tubes on its
surface as by the fact that it yields and breaks under
pressure, and exhibits an organic structure within. When
heated slightly, water rises from it, and also a little ammonia;
and, if heated still more highly in the air, the carbon
burns away, and a bulky white ash is left, retaining the
shape and size of the 'stone.' This ash, as is evident
from inspection, cannot have belonged to any vegetable
substance, for it is almost entirely composed of phosphate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of lime. Mr Faraday adds that 'if the piece of matter
has ever been employed as a spongy absorbent, it seems
hardly fit for that purpose in its present state; but who
can say to what treatment it has been subjected since it
was fit for use, or to what treatment the natives may
submit it when expecting to have occasion to use it?'"</p>

<p>Sir E. Tennent supposes that the animal charcoal may be
sufficiently absorbent to extract the venom from the recent
wound together with a portion of the blood, before it has
had time to be carried into the system. If this be so the
process is analogous to that of sucking a poisoned wound,
already referred to.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>What the author means by a jungle vine I do not
exactly know, but conjecture that it may be one of the
<i>Bignoniace&aelig;</i>, the woody climbing species of which have
in general their stem divided into lobes arranged in a
quadrangular manner. I am not aware that any species
of this order is an antidote to animal poisons, but many
have powerful medicinal properties, and abound in bitter
juices. The whitewood of Jamaica (<i>Bignonia leucoxylon</i>)
enjoys a reputation as a remedy for the poison of the
Manchineel (<i>Hippomane mancinella</i>) which is so virulent
that persons are reported to have been killed by its volatile
emanations, when accidentally sleeping under its shade,
and a drop of its juice falling on the skin burns it like
fire, and produces an ulcer difficult to heal. The value of
the <i>Aristolochia</i> has been already referred to; and on the
whole I am disposed to attach more importance to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
use of vegetable specifics by the Ceylonese operators than
the learned author whom I have just quoted. The subject
is a highly curious one, and well worthy of minute
investigation by able and unprejudiced men of science,
willing to receive unscientific information and suggestions,
in various parts of the world, particularly in the intertropical
regions of both hemispheres.</p>

<h2>BEAUTY.</h2>


<p>Very much of the delight with which we pursue natural
history is surely due to the almost constant recognition of
the beautiful. I do not know that I could say with the
poet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A thing of beauty is a joy <i>for ever</i>;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but certainly it is a joy as long as it endures; and the
naturalist finds an endless recurrence of things of beauty.
Birds, insects, shells, zoophytes, flowers, sea-weeds, are all
redundant of beauty; and all the classes of natural objects,
though not in an equal degree, nor manifestly in
every individual object, yet possess it as a prominent
element. Indeed, from the profusion with which loveliness
is sown broadcast over the works of God, I have often
thought, though it is not directly revealed, that a sense of
the beautiful and a complacency in it, altogether independent
of fitness for certain ends, or the uses which may
be subserved, is an attribute of the Holy One Himself,
and that our perception of it is the reflection of His&mdash;a
part of that image of God in which man was created, and
which sin has not wholly obliterated. I know that God
may have clothed His works with beauty for other admir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>ing
eyes than man's; and that it is probable that the holy
angels may be far more conversant with creation than we
are with all our researches,&mdash;that the ten thousand times
ten thousand flowers which are "born to blush unseen"
by <i>man</i>, may be seen and admired by "ten thousand
times ten thousand" angels,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and thus the tribute of
praise for their perfection may be ever ascending before
Him whose hands made them for His glory. We may
allow this; and yet with reverence presume that His own
pure eyes look upon the lilies' array with a delight in
their mere loveliness, infinitely greater than that which
men, or even angels, take in it, seeing it is written,&mdash;"for
thy pleasure they are, and were created."</p>

<p>I remember being struck, and somewhat awed, too, with
a thought of this kind, once, when, pushing my way through
a very dense and tangled thicket in a lone and lofty mountain
region of Jamaica, sufficiently remote from the dwellings
of man to render it probable that no civilized human
foot had penetrated thither before. I suddenly came upon
a most magnificent terrestrial orchid in full blossom. It
was <i>Phajus Tankervilli&aelig;</i>,&mdash;a noble plant, which from the
midst of broad leaves growing out of a mass of green
bulbs, had thrown up its stout blossom-stems to the
height of a yard or more, crowned with the pyramidal
spike of lily-like flowers, whose expanding petals of pure
white on one side and golden brown on the other, and
trumpet-lip of gorgeous purple seemed, to my ravished
gaze, the very perfection of beauty. For ages, I thought,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
that beauteous flower had been growing in that wild and
unvisited spot, every season "filling the air around with
beauty," and had in all probability never met a single
human gaze before. Had, then, all that divinely-formed
loveliness been mere waste for those generations? I asked
myself; and I immediately replied, No: the eye of God
himself hath rested on it with satisfaction, and the Lord
hath taken pleasure in this work of His hands.</p>

<p>I shall not make this chapter an essay on the sublime
and beautiful, nor seek to analyse the sense of beauty. It
is enough that it is an appetite of our being, and that
most abundantly in nature, on every side, there is the
material of its gratification. So abundantly, indeed, that
it were easy to expand the few pages which I propose to
devote to the subject into a volume, or a dozen volumes, and
yet leave untouched vast treasures of the beautiful in natural
history. I must content myself and my readers with the
selection of a few of the more prominent objects in which
this sense is gratified, and with a discrimination of two or
three distinct phases or conditions of existence which contribute,
each in its measure, to give delight to the eyes.</p>

<a href="images/fig331-1200.jpg"><img src="images/fig331-400.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="ANTELOPES." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">ANTELOPES.</span>
</div>

<p>Among Quadrupeds, there is perhaps less of beauty,
strictly considered, than in most other classes of animals.
Elegance of form, however, which is one phase of it, is
seen in the lithe and active squirrel, the pretty petaurist,
and many other of the smaller beasties, and is found in
perfection in the deer and antelopes. Who that has seen
a pet fawn coming to be caressed by a fair girl, but must
have had his sense of the beautiful gratified? Mark the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>freedom and grace of every motion! See how it stretches
out its pretty meek face and taper neck towards the hand;
its extreme timidity causing its whole body and every
limb to start on the slightest stir from the beholders,
while on the least approach it bounds away in the exuberant
playfulness of its little heart, then stops, and turns, and
gazes, and stretches out its neck again! See when it trots
or walks, how high it lifts its little slender feet, bending
its agile limbs as if motion itself were a pleasure! See,
as it stands, with one fore-foot bent up, the hoof nearly
touching the belly; the long graceful ears moving this
way and that, now thrown forwards, now backwards, now
erected, to catch the slightest sound,&mdash;what a picture of
fairy grace it is! There is beauty, too, in the soft, full
liquid eye of these animals,&mdash;the "bright, black eye" of
the "dear gazelle," which in the East is the very ideal of
female loveliness. Its melting gaze seems full of tenderness,
so that we cannot look without loving it.</p>

<p>Nor is beauty of colour wholly wanting. How rich is
the tawny fur of the tiger, dashed with its black streaks!
And the brighter yellow of the leopard and the jaguar,
studded all over with rosettes of black spots! We forget
the ferocity of the savage in its beautifully-painted coat.
The zebra, too,&mdash;with the fine contrast of those bands of
richest sable on the cream-coloured ground, now bold and
broad, as on the rounded body, now running in fine
parallel but irregularly-waved lines, as on the face,&mdash;is a
beautiful quadruped; and a herd of them galloping wan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>tonly
over a South African plain, must be a sight worth
seeing indeed.</p>

<p>When we come to Birds, however, beauty is not the
exception, but the rule. The form of a bird is almost
always graceful; the rounded swellings and undulations
of outline, and the smoothness of the plumage give pleasure
to the eye, even when there is no attractiveness of
hue. One has almost a difficulty in naming an inelegant
bird. But when, as in a thousand instances, brilliancy of
colouring is combined with elegance of shape and smoothness
of plumage, we must be charmed. Is not our own
little goldfinch, is not the pert chaffinch that comes up to
our very feet for a grain or a crumb, a pretty object?
But the tropical birds,&mdash;we must look at them if we wish
to know what nature can do in the way of adornment.
We should go to the flats on the embouchure of the
Amazon, and see the rosy spoonbills, in their delicate
carnation dress, set off by the lustrous crimson of their
shoulders and breast-tufts, feeding by hundreds on the
green mud, or watch the gorgeous ibises, all clad in
glowing scarlet with black-tipped wings, when, in serried
ranks, a mile in length, like the vermillion cloud of morning,
they come to their breeding-place,&mdash;a truly magnificent
sight.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The first of the Parrot tribe that I ever had an opportunity
of seeing in its native freedom was the beautiful
Parrakeet of the Southern States. Eighty or a hundred
birds in one compact flock passed me flying low, and all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>nearly on the same plane; and, as they swept by, screaming
as they went, I fancied that they looked like an immense
shawl of green satin, on which an irregular pattern
was worked in scarlet and gold and azure. The sun's
rays were brilliantly reflected from the gorgeous surface,
which rapidly sped past like a splendid vision.</p>

<p>The Cock of the Rock is a fine South American bird of
the richest orange colour, crowned with a double crest of
feathers edged with purple. Mr Wallace describes his
search for it on the Rio Negro, and his admiration of its
beauty. Some time he sought in vain, for it is a rare
bird, till the old Indian who was his guide suddenly
caught him by the arm, and, pointing to a dense thicket,
whispered in a low tone, "Gallo!" Peering through the
foliage, the naturalist caught a glimpse of the magnificent
bird, sitting amidst the gloom, and shining out like a
mass of brilliant flame. As it is easily alarmed and very
wary, it required some following and perseverance before
he shot it. One of his Indians descended into the deep
rocky glen into which it fell, and brought it to him. "I
was lost," he says, "in admiration of the dazzling beauty
of its soft downy feathers; not a spot of blood was visible,
not a feather was ruffled, and the soft, warm, flexible body
set off the fresh swelling plumage in a manner which no
stuffed specimen can approach."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>There is something exquisitely pleasing to the eye in
the delicate painting of the soft plumage in most of the
Goatsuckers and their allies. Entirely destitute of bril<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>liant
hues as they are, the combinations of warm browns,
and cool greys, interchanged with black and white, and
the manner in which these are softened, and blended, and
minutely pencilled, produce an effect that is peculiarly
charming.</p>

<p>In the Trogons of the tropical regions we see elegance
of form combined with the most gorgeous colouring.
Green and gold, crimson, scarlet, orange, and black, are
the hues of these birds, which hide themselves in the deep
dark recesses of the Amazonian and Indian forests. That
species called the Resplendent is the noblest of the race,
whose magnificence was so well appreciated by the ancient
Mexican emperors, that none but members of the royal
family were permitted to adorn themselves with its flowing
plumes. The whole upper parts of this bird, its fine
coronal crest of erectile plumes, its shoulder-hackles, or
long lance-shaped feathers, that droop over the sides, and
the elongated tail-coverts which hang down beyond the
tail to a length of three feet or more, curving elegantly
under the bird, as it sits on a branch, are of the richest
golden green, shining with a satiny radiance. The under
parts are of a splendid scarlet, and the tail feathers are
white, with broad black bars.</p>

<p>More enchanting than mere colour, however rich and
glowing this may be, is the fine metallic reflection which
we see on the plumage of many tropical birds. The Rifle-bird
of Australia might be seen sitting on a tree, and be
passed by with contempt as a mere crow, while the eye
was attracted to a more gaily-hued parrot by its side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
But viewed close at hand, in the full blaze of the sun, the
darker-plumaged bird is seen to exceed the other by far,
in gorgeous glory, and to be not unworthy of the specific
title of <i>Paradiseus</i>, by which it is known to naturalists.
The body generally is of a deep velvet black, but it reflects
a purple flush on the upper parts, and the feathers
of the under parts are edged with olive-green. The crown
of the head, and the whole throat, are clothed with scale-like
feathers of the brightest emerald-green, which blaze
with a gemmeous lustre in certain lights, and make the
most vivid contrast with the velvet of the body. The tail
displays its two middle feathers of the same lustrous
green, while the bordering ones are deep black.</p>

<p>The vast and little-known island of Papua contains
some specimens of the feathered race of surpassing glory.
The <i>Epimachi</i>, or Plume-birds, take a prominent place in
this category. They are remarkable for the erectile scale-like
feathers of the sides and shoulders, which form large
fan-shaped tufts, standing out from the body in a very
striking manner. Speaking of the superb Epimachus,
Sonnerat, its describer, thus writes:&mdash;"As if to add to
the singularity of this bird, nature has placed above and
below its wings feathers of an extraordinary form, and
such as one does not see in other birds; she seems, moreover,
to have pleased herself in painting this being, already
so singular, with her most brilliant colours. The head,
the neck, and the belly are glittering green; the feathers
which cover these parts possess the lustre and softness of
velvet to the eye and touch; the back is changeable violet;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the wings are of the same colour, and appear, according
to the lights in which they are held, blue, violet, or deep
black; always, however, imitating velvet. The tail is
composed of twelve feathers, the two middle feathers are
the longest, and the lateral feathers gradually diminish;
it is violet, or changeable blue above, and black beneath.
The feathers which compose it are as wide in proportion
as they are long, and shine above and below with the brilliancy
of polished metal.</p>

<p>"Above the wings the scapularies are very long and
singularly formed; their points being very short on one
side, and very long on the other. These feathers are of
the colour of polished steel, changing into blue, terminated
by a large spot of brilliant green, and forming a species
of tuft or appendage at the margin of the wings.</p>

<p>"Below the wings spring long curved feathers, directed
upwards; these are black on the inside, and brilliant green
on the outside. The bill and feet are black."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>The same author, in referring to the brilliant metallic
hues of this and other birds, takes occasion to notice the
iridescent effect which is produced by the different angle
at which light falls on the feathers. The emerald-green,
for instance, will often fling out rays of its two constituent
primary colours, at one time being blue-green, at
another gold-green, while in certain lights all colour
vanishes, and a velvet-black is presented to the eye. The
ruby feathers of several birds become orange under certain
lights, and darken to a crimson-black at other times.</p>

<div><a name="Fig.9" id="Fig.9">&nbsp;</a></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">

<span class="caption">MOURNING THE DEAD CUCKOO.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>
<p>This change of hue is analogous to the well-known iridescent
changeableness of the nacre which lines various
shells, and is owing to the structure of its surface reflecting
the light in different rays, according to the angle at
which it falls upon the feathers.</p>

<p>Another species, a native of the same teeming region,
the Twelve-thread Epimachus, glows, with equal lustre, in
the richest violet and emerald, but somewhat diversely
arranged. The long, elegant depending tail is here reduced
to ordinary dimensions, but, as if to compensate for this
inferiority, the Twelve-thread is adorned with an expanding
dress of the purest snowy white, composed of long silky
plumes that spring from behind and below the wings, so
soft and so loosely webbed as to wave gracefully in the
slightest breeze. From these tufts project long and very
slender shafts, unwebbed, and as fine as threads, curling
elegantly, six on each side.</p>

<p>The little Sun-birds of India and Africa, and the still
tinier Humming-birds of the New World are conspicuous
for the metallic radiance of their plumage. Take for an
example of the former the Fire-tailed Sun-bird of Nep&acirc;l.
The crown and forehead are brilliant steel-blue, while the
neck, the back, and the rump are of the richest scarlet,
diversified by a broad patch of bright yellow across the
middle of the back. The central feathers of the tail are
lengthened, and are bright scarlet, while the lateral
feathers are edged with the same rich hue on brown.
The breast is golden yellow or orange, flushed with
crimson in the centre, and the rest of the inferior parts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
are olive-green. Most of those gorgeous colours have a
silky or metallic lustre, and blaze out under the tropical
sunlight with amazing brightness.</p>

<p>Exquisite ornaments are these to an Indian garden,
where they delight in the flowering plants and shrubs.
They creep to and fro about the stalks and twigs, clinging
by their little purple feet, and rifling the tubular corollas
of the honeyed blossoms, whence doubtless they gather
many minute insects, licked up with the nectar, by the aid
of their curiously pencilled tongue.</p>

<p>For that peculiar charm which resides in flashing light
combined with the most brilliant colours, the lustre of
precious stones, there are no birds, no creatures, that can
compare with the Humming-birds. Confined exclusively
to America,&mdash;whence we have already gathered between
three and four hundred distinct species, and more are
being continually discovered,&mdash;these lovely little winged
gems were to the Mexican and Peruvian Indians the very
quintessence of beauty. By these simple people they were
called by various names signifying "the rays of the sun,"
"the tresses of the day-star," and the like. Their glittering
scale-like plumage was employed to make, at the cost
of immense time, patience, and labour, the radiant mantles
in which the emperors and highest nobles appeared on
state occasions, as well as to form by a sort of mosaic,
those embroidered pictures which so attracted the admiration
of the Spanish conquerors. The Mexican priests
adopted the tiny birds into their mythology: they taught
that the souls of those warriors who died in defence of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
gods, were conducted by Toyamiqui, the wife of the god
of war, straight to the mansion of the sun, and there
transformed into humming-birds.</p>

<p>In the gorgeous forest glooms of the mountainous parts
of Jamaica, and especially in the sunny glades which here
and there break their uniformity, where the ever-verdant
foliage rises upon all sides of the open space like a wall,
covered with the most elegant and fragrant flowers, I have
been charmed by the familiar fearlessness and lustrous
splendour of these little creatures. Here sitting down on
a prostrate log in the shadow, I have watched them sipping
all around, flitting to and fro, coming and going, every
moment disappearing in the sombre shade, or suddenly
flashing out, with a whirr like that of a spinning-wheel,
into the bright sunshine. Bold and unsuspecting, they
might be seen exploring bush after bush, and coming,
while I remained motionless, even within arm's length of
me, busily rifling all the blossoms in rapid succession,
regularly quartering the surface of some favourite shrub,
so as to lose none, and of course, in their zeal, frequently
probing the same flower again and again. Sometimes it
would be the Mango, suspending himself on whirring
pinions in front of the flowers, his broadly-expanded tail-feathers
of the richest violet, his body plumage all green
and gold, and his cheeks and throat blazing, in the changing
light, with the radiance now of the ruby, now of the
amethyst, now of the sapphire, and now becoming for an
instant the most intense black. But much more commonly
on these occasions was I visited by the elegant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
Long-tail, whose slender form, black velvet crest, emerald
bosom, and long tail-plumes, distinguish it as one of the
<i>principes</i> of this patrician race. This lovely little gem
would be hovering about, half-a-dozen visible at the same
moment, threading the projecting branches, now probing
here, now there, one moment above a flower and bending
down to it, the next hanging below it, and thrusting up
its crimson beak to kiss its nectar-tube from beneath, the
cloudy wings on each side vibrating with a noise like that
of a factory wheel, and its entire throat, breast and belly
clothed in scaly plumage of the richest green, contrasted
finely with the velvety black of all beside. This scaly
plumage would flash brilliantly back the sun's light, like
a noble emerald in the crown of a king; then, by the
slightest possible turn of the bird, it would become black,
all the light being absorbed; then, on another movement,
it would seem a dark rich olive, and in an instant flame
forth again with emerald effulgence, over which olive and
black clouds were momentarily passing and repassing.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of this changing lustre is worthy of
more careful attention than it has received. In such
Humming-birds as I have examined,&mdash;and possibly it may
be a general rule,&mdash;the iridescence of those portions of
the plumage that are changeable is splendid in the ratio
of the acuteness of the angle formed by the incident ray
and the reflected one. Thus the scaly plumage of the
neck of the Mango appears to advantage in a room with a
single window, only when the beholder stands with his
back to the light, and has the bird before him and facing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
him. Then the perpendicular band down the throat and
breast, which seems composed of the richest black velvet,
is bounded on each side by a broad band of glowing crimson,
mingled with violet. It is not the <i>entire</i> plumage of
even a Humming-bird that displays these refulgent gleams:
some of the brilliant hues are permanent, not changeable
colours; such as the golden greens which adorn the back
and wing-coverts in so many species; in which the
colour is subject to little change, and the only effect produced
by the alteration of the angle of the light is the
transforming the tips of the feathers into the appearance
of burnished gold.</p>

<p>Wilson<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> has remarked that the plumage of the Indigo
finch (<i>Fringilla cyanea</i>) in certain lights appears of a
rich sky-blue and in others of a vivid verdigris green, so
that the same bird, in passing from one place to another
before your eyes, seems to undergo a total change of
colour. When the rays of light so fall on the plumage
that the angle of the incident and reflected ray is acute,
the colour is green, when obtuse, blue. I have myself
noticed exactly the same thing in the brilliant changeable
colour of insects,&mdash;as, for instance, the <i>Cicindel&aelig;</i> of
America, and the Emerald Virgin Dragonfly (<i>Agrion
Virginica</i>.)</p>

<p>To return, however, to our Humming-birds, of which
my readers will like to have one or two more described,&mdash;<i>la
cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</i>, the very <i>&eacute;lite</i> of this lovely little
fairy population. If we were to cross the Atlantic to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>Brazil, track up the mighty Amazon some thirty days'
sail, and a distance of a thousand miles, we should come
to the mouth of the Rio Negro, where a remarkable
change in the appearance of the water indicates a totally
different region. Instead of the muddy water of the
Amazon, resembling pea-soup, that of the Negro is intensely
dark, but clear and limpid, every ripple sparkling
like crystal. The land becomes high, and the river, some
four miles wide, passes between lofty cliffs, crowned with
the rich green walls of the primeval forest. The country
is far more attractive than that on the Amazon; instead
of a dead level, swampy and intersected by sluggish
<i>igarip&eacute;s</i>, or shallow ponds, overhung by impenetrably
tangled thickets, and full of venomous flies, here are
gentle hills, and tiny brooks of sparkling water, and a
comparatively open forest, with bright clear glades in
which the traveller may recline without persecution from
the flies,&mdash;these pests being unknown on the "black
waters." The ground is covered by evergreens of different
species and exquisite forms, and many kinds of elegant
ferns are growing in the valleys. There are few lianes or
spinous briers stretching from tree to tree, obstructing
free passage, but a thousand lesser vines drape the low tree
tops with myriads of flowers, new and attractive to the
visitor. Everywhere the forest is intersected by paths,
some made by the inhabitants in their frequent rambles,
others by wild animals that come to the water to drink;
and along these the eager naturalist can readily pass to
the feeding trees of many beautiful and peculiar birds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are wont to haunt many varieties of the richly-hued
trogons, unknown to the lower regions; and at any
hour their plaintive note may be heard at intervals, as
they sit moodily, singly or in pairs, on the branches, with
the long tail outspread and drooping, watching for passing
insects. Cuckoos of several kinds, their plumage glancing
red in the subdued light, flit noiselessly through the woods,
searching for caterpillars. Purple jays, in large flocks,
alight on some berry-bearing tree, chattering and gesticulating,
but shy and alert,&mdash;ready to start at the snapping
of a twig. Motmots and chatterers in gayest hues,&mdash;scarlet,
violet and blue,&mdash;are abundant. Goatsuckers, in
exquisitely-blended and pencilled tones of colour, start
from some shady glen where they are dozing away the
day hours, and, flying a short distance on soft winnowing
pinions, rest again, and seem to fall asleep in an instant.
Showy manikins and tanagers of the brightest tints are
flaunting in every bush: pigeons and doves of soberer
hues are cooing their gentle complainings in the taller
trees; and guans and curassows are marching with stately
pace in the paths, picking here and there some delicate
morsel; or running with loud harsh cry, with outstretched
neck and rapid stride, as they detect approaching danger.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Still, conspicuous above all are the Humming-birds,
which, revelling in this region of the sun, are buzzing
around the blossoming shrubs like insects. And pre-eminent
among these is the Fiery Topaz, a name that
attempts to express what neither title, nor description,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>nor coloured figure can adequately express,&mdash;its gemmeous
magnificence and lustre. One of the first ornithologists
of the age, the Prince of Canino, has assigned
to the species the honour of being "<i>inter Trochilides
pulcherrimus</i>." Description, however, I must give, for
want of anything better, since, even if I possessed a living
specimen, I could not exhibit its living radiance to all my
readers: therefore, pray pay attention to the details, and
imagine. The general hue of this imperial atom is a
blazing scarlet, in fine contrast with which the head and
lower part of the throat are deep velvet-black. The
gorget of the throat is emerald green, with a cloud of
delicate crimson in the centre. The lower part of the
back, the rump and the upper tail-coverts are of that
beautiful bronzed green which changes to orange gold, so
frequently seen in this tribe; while the wing-quills and
tail are purplish black, except the middle pair of feathers
in the latter, which are very slender, project to a great
length, and cross each other; these are green with a
purple gloss.</p>

<p>Among the hundreds of species of this very lovely
tribe that swarm in the intertropical regions of South
America, I will select one more for its surpassing beauty.
It is the Bar-tailed Comet. We must look for it in the
temperate and equable valley of the Desaguedero, which
leads out of Lake Titi&ccedil;a&ccedil;a, the largest sheet of water on
the South American continent, and famous in Peruvian
tradition, as the scene where Mango Capac and Mama
Ocollo surprised the barbarous aborigines by their first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
appearance. On one of the charming islets of this quiet
lake, the two august strangers were seen, clothed in garments;
and, declaring that they were the children of the
sun long prophesied of, proceeded to teach their simple
subjects the arts of civilisation, and to establish a regular
government. We must search for our tiny Comet, too, in
the cultivated plains that surround the Cerro of Potosi,
that singular cone sixteen thousand feet in height, which
is wholly composed of silver, and which is estimated to
have yielded, during the three hundred years that have
elapsed since the Indian exposed the solid silver, when he
accidentally tore up a shrub by the roots,&mdash;the sum of
two hundred millions of pounds sterling. The districts
around, and specially the environs of the town of Chuquisaca,
are adorned with a profusion of gardens and orchards,
in which many European trees and flowers grow, as well
as those of the tropics, the climate possessing the charms
of many regions. In the shrubberies of the city, and in
the gardens of the Indian cottages, as well as the slopes
of the surrounding mountains, where the native groves and
forests grow undisturbed, the brilliant Bar-tail may be
seen during the summer months; but, as soon as the
chilling winds of April tell of coming winter, the charming
visitor becomes scarce, and flitting northward finds in
the forests of Lower Peru the mild and balmy air which
he loves. When the trees are in blossom, and particularly
the apple-trees, which have been introduced from Europe,
and are largely cultivated in orchards, the males may be
seen shooting in and out among the foliage, like glowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
coals of fire, chasing each other with shrill chirpings, and
with surprising perseverance and acrimony. The fields of
maize, and pulse, and other leguminous plants which are
cultivated in the plains, receive a fair share of his attention;
and the nop&acirc;leries, or cactus-gardens, where the
cochineal insect is reared for those most valuable crimson
and scarlet dyes, which far outshine the vaunted productions
of ancient Tyre. The blossom of the nop&acirc;l is itself
one of the most splendid of flowers. It begins to open as
the sun declines, and is in full expanse throughout the
night, shedding a delicious fragrance, and offering its
brimming goblet, filled with nectareous juice, to thousands
of moths, and other crepuscular and nocturnal insects.
When the moon is at the full in those cloudless nights
whose loveliness is known only in the tropics, the broad
blossom is seen as a circular disk nearly a foot in diameter,
very full of petals, of which the outer series are of a yellowish
hue, gradually paling to the centre, where they
shine in the purest white. The numerous recurving
stamens surround the style which rises in the midst
like a polished shaft, the whole glowing in its silvery
beauty under the moonbeams, from the dark and matted
foliage, and diffusing its delicious clove-like fragrance so
profusely that the air is loaded with it for furlongs round.</p>

<p>Other species of Cactus and Cereus, some with yellow,
and some with pink, and some with rich crimson blossoms,&mdash;the
pride of our conservatories,&mdash;sprawl profusely in
these gardens; and here the Bar-tail flaunts all day long
sipping the nectar, and picking up myriads of minute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
insects which the blossoms attract, and which lodge in the
honeyed recesses.</p>

<p>But it is time that the reader should know what sort of
a bird this Bar-tailed Comet is. Attend, then, while I
describe his ball-dress, more lustrous than any fair lady
ever wore at Almack's. The head, neck, upper part of
the back, and a considerable portion of the under surface,
are light green, with reflections of burnished gold on the
cheeks and forehead. The lower back is of a deep crimson.
The throat flames like an emerald. The tail is the
chief feature, the feathers being broad, and greatly lengthened,
in regular graduation from the central ones to the
outmost pair, which are double the length of the entire
bird besides. The form of the tail is widely forked, its
outline having a double curve, somewhat lyre-shaped. The
tail-coverts are ruddy brown; and the feathers themselves
are of the richest and most glowing fire-colour, incomparably
lustrous; each feather being broadly tipped with
velvety black. The graduation of the feathers throws
these terminal black tips to a considerable distance from
each other, and their alternation with the intermediate
spaces of the fiery glow has an inconceivably charming
effect, as the bird makes its rapid evolutions through the
air, and whisks about among the flowers, with a velocity
which the eye of the beholder can scarcely follow. It is
very fond of certain long trumpet-shaped pendent blossoms,
into which it penetrates so far, that nothing of it
can be seen except the tips of its radiant forked tail projecting
from the tube.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Another family of birds that is conspicuous for gorgeous
beauty is that of the Pheasants. Our own familiar
species, which is said to have been brought long ages ago
from the banks of the Phasis in Colchis, by Jason in the
Argo,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Argiv&acirc; primum sum transportata carin&acirc;,"<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is a very splendid bird, and is well painted in a few lines
by Pope;&mdash;who speaks of his</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Glossy varying dyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His purple crest and scarlet-circled eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vivid green his shining plumes unfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His painted wings, and breast that flames with gold."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But besides this, there are Indian and Chinese species
which excel it in glory. There are the richly-pencilled
Gold and Silver Pheasants, and the noble Reeves' and
Amherst Pheasants, with their extraordinary long-barred
tail plumes. The last named is a bird of unusual magnificence.</p>

<p>Then there is the splendid Fire-back of Sumatra and
Java, which is adorned with a crest of slender stalked
feathers, each expanding into a disk with spreading barbs.
The head, neck, breast, and belly of this rare bird are of
deep steel-blue, very lustrous, the lower part of the back
fiery orange-red or flame-colour, varying in intensity according
to the incidence of the light, and passing like a
zone of fire round the body, though less brilliant on the
abdomen; the rump and tail-coverts broad and truncate,
bluish-green, each feather tipped by a paler bar. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
tail is erect and arched, somewhat like that of the common
cock, its middle feathers are pure white, and all the rest
black, with green reflections. The legs and feet, which are
scarlet, and the skin of the face, purple, complete the toilet
of this magnificent oriental.</p>

<p>What shall we say to the Argus Pheasant, the bird of
Malacca with the magnificent pinions? How fine a sight
must it be to see this noble fowl displaying his coxcombery
in the presence of his admiring hens, strutting to and
fro with his long tail feathers spread and erected, and his
broad wings expanded and scraping the ground far on
each side! The colours, it is true, are sober browns,
varied with black and white; but how exquisitely are
these arranged! Perhaps no brilliancy of tint would
more charm the eye than the row of ocellated spots,&mdash;each
a dark circular disk surrounded by concentric circles,&mdash;that
runs along the centre of each of the enormously-developed
secondary wing-quills.</p>

<p>To come back to colour and metallic refulgence. We
must not overlook the Mon&acirc;l, or Scaly Impeyan of the
Himalaya chain. This fowl, which is little less than a
turkey, looks as if clothed in scale armour of iridescent
metal, of which the specific hues can scarcely be indicated,
so changeable are they; green, steel-blue, crimson, purple,
and golden-bronze,&mdash;all of the utmost intensity of colour,
and of dazzling refulgence, adorn this bird, set off by a
broad square patch of pure white in the middle of the
back, while the crown of the head carries a drooping crest
of naked-shafted, broad-tipped, green feathers. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
splendid fowl is as hardy as the turkey or pheasant,
and will probably before long be domesticated in British
preserves, to which it would be a noble addition, being
perhaps exceeded by nothing in nature for refulgence.</p>

<p>In the same regions are found the Polyplectrons, or
Pheasant Peacocks, birds of the same family. Look at
one of these in detail, the Crested Polyplectron of the
Sunda Isles. It much resembles a peacock in contour,
the head and neck black, with steely reflections, relieved
by a long stripe of white arching over each eye, and a
broad patch of the same on the ears. The forehead and
crown carry a crest of tall feathers capable of erection,
and making a fine ornament. The whole under parts are
velvet black; the back and rump warm brown, with paler
wavy bands and lines. The coverts and secondary feathers
of the wings are of the richest blue, each feather tipped
with velvety black. But the tail is the grand display. It
is a true tail, not a train of superincumbent feathers as in
the peacock, the quill-feathers being of great length and
breadth, and the whole capable of being widely expanded
into an enormous rounded fan. The individual feathers
are brown, pencilled and sprinkled with pale buff,&mdash;a
pretty ground, on each of which is painted two large
oval eye-spots of the most brilliant metallic blue or green,
according to the light, contained within encircling double
rings of black and white. These refulgent eyes are so
set that they constitute two curved bands placed at some
distance apart, running across the tail, and when this organ
is expanded they impart to it a most regal appearance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>Last, but not least, in this distinguished tribe, there is
the familiar Peacock, a proverb of splendour in raiment
from the remote antiquity of Aristophanes and Aristotle
to Mr Hollingshead, who lashes the sumptuary tendencies
of our modern ladies under the title of "Peacockism."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
The true Peacock, however, the genuine bird, may at least
plead that no milliners' bills of &pound;3000 are ever proved
against him in Bankruptcy Courts.</p>

<p>I am not going to be so impertinent as to describe in
detail the plumage of a bird so well known as the Peacock.
Who does not know his empurpled neck so elegantly
bridled, his aigrette of four-and-twenty battledore-feathers,
his pencilled body-clothing, and, above all, his
grand erectile train with its rows of eyelets? Who has
not admired the lustre and beauty of those eyelets,&mdash;the
kidney-like nucleus of deepest purple, the surrounding
band of green, widening in front and filling the notch of
the pupil, the broad circle of brown, and the narrow black
ring edged with chestnut, and then the decomposed barbs
of the feather, gilded green, all presenting the effulgence
of burnished metal, or rather the glitter and glow of precious
gems, flashing in the varying light? One can hardly
imagine the splendour of the scene described by Colonel
Williamson, as seen by him in the Jungleterry District in
India, when, being engaged shooting these beautiful fowl,
he estimates that not fewer than twelve or fifteen hundred
Peafowl of various sizes were within sight of him for
nearly an hour. "Whole woods were covered with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
beautiful plumage, to which the rising sun imparted additional
brilliancy. Small patches of plain among the long
grass, most of them cultivated, and with mustard then in
bloom, which induced the birds to feed, increased the
beauty of the scene."</p>

<p>In the preceding volume I have spoken of the gorgeous
beauty of the Birds of Paradise, and have quoted the description
given by Lesson of his rapt feelings when, on
first seeing a specimen in the forests of Papua, he could
not shoot from emotion. A chapter on animal beauty
cannot pass over this magnificent family, though to my
own taste there is something in the refulgent radiance of
the Humming-birds and Pheasants which is superior
to anything seen in the Paradise-birds. The latter, or
some of them at least, give me the idea of being over-dressed,
particularly that one called the Superb, whose
singular forked gorget and shoulder-cape, gorgeous as
these adornments are, with their lustrous violet and green
flushes, are somewhat inelegant in form. Yet some of
them are softly beautiful;&mdash;</p>

<p>The Emerald Paradise, the best known of the family,
seems to have been in the poet's eye; and certainly the
combination of form and colour in this species is very
charming. The rich chocolate of the upper parts, and the
delicate lemon-yellow of the neck, contrast well with the
gemmeous green lustre of the front, when the velvety
plumage flashes and gleams in the sunlight. And the
numerous soft floating plumes that arch out from the
flanks to a great distance on all sides are exquisite in
loveliness. "Even in the absolute quiet of a stuffed skin
under a glass case," as Mr Wood remarks, "these plumes
are full of astonishing beauty, their translucent golden-white
vanelets producing a most superb effect as they
cross and recross each other, forming every imaginable
shade of white, gold and orange, and then deepening
towards their extremities into a soft purplish red."</p>

<p>Mr G. Bennett, who saw a living specimen in an aviary
at Macao, describes these long, elegant, loose-barbed
plumes as occupying a good deal of the bird's own attention
and care. "One of the best opportunities of seeing
this splendid bird in all its beauty of action as well as
display of plumage, is early in the morning, when he
makes his toilet: the beautiful sub-alar plumage is then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
thrown out and cleaned from any spot that may sully its
purity, by being passed gently through the bill; the short
chocolate wings are extended to the utmost, and he keeps
them in a steady flapping motion as if in imitation of
their use in flight, at the same time raising up the delicate
long feathers over the back, which are spread in a chaste
and elegant manner, floating like films in the ambient air.
In this position the bird would remain for a short time,
seemingly proud of its heavenly beauty, and in raptures
of delight with its most enchanting self; it would then
assume various attitudes, so as to regard its plumage in
every direction."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Passing over all other classes of animate existence, I
shall say a few words on the surpassing loveliness which
is displayed by many of the Insect tribes. The nursery
prejudice, that these creatures are worthy only to be trodden
under foot, as things repulsive and disgusting, is
certainly decaying, though it retains its hold still in some
minds. A glance through an entomological cabinet would
prove how unjust are such notions. If brilliant hues,
polished surface, sculptured chasings, graceful forms, and
lively motions can command admiration, these are displayed
by Insects to a degree which we should in vain look
for in any other class of creatures. We need not speak of
simple colours; these occur in profusion, of all hues, of
all shades of intensity, and of the very highest degrees of
brightness; combined too, in the most elegant manner,
and very frequently, particularly in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>presenting that peculiar charm which results from the
association of tints that are complemental to each other.</p>

<p>Words are always felt to be too poor to describe the
refulgence of the hues of many of the feathered tribes;&mdash;the
metallic gloss of the Trogons and the oriental <i>Gallinace&aelig;</i>,
the gem-like flashings of the Humming-birds and
the Birds of Paradise. Perhaps it would be deemed extravagant
to assert, that these glories can be <i>excelled</i> by the
tiny races I am now discussing; but equalled, <i>most fully
equalled</i>, they assuredly are. To possess the glow of
burnished metal upon the most varied hues, is, in the
order <i>Coleoptera</i>, a common thing. Most of the <i>Eumolpid&aelig;</i>
are remarkable for this; of which I may instance
<i>Chrysochus fulgidus</i>, a beetle from Bombay. The <i>Buprestid&aelig;</i>
have long been celebrated, for the same reason;
and portions of their bodies have been used in the toilet
of ladies, in association with diamonds and rubies.</p>

<p>Many of the <i>Chlamyd&aelig;</i> blaze with golden-crimson,
purple, and the most fiery orange. The species of the
small genus <i>Eurhinus</i> seem to send forth the coloured
flames of the pyrotechnic art. The <i>Longicornes</i> display the
same beauties, associated with gigantic size. <i>Cheloderus
Childreni</i>, for example, a large beetle from Columbia, is
equal to any <i>Buprestis</i> for the radiance of the green,
crimson, purple, blue, scarlet, and gold, that are all at the
same time flaming from its singularly-sculptured surface.</p>

<p>But there are impressions conveyed by the reflection of
light from the bodies of many beetles, which far exceed
the metallic fulgor of which I have been speaking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
beautiful as it is. I cannot hope to describe them intelligibly;
I know of no combination of words which
will give an idea of them. I mean the soft, almost
velvety radiance of some of the <i>Goliathi</i>; of many of
the <i>Cetoni&aelig;</i>, as the genus <i>Eudicella</i>, for instance; and
of not a few of the <i>Phan&aelig;i</i>, in the former two, the hue
is generally green; in the latter, this colour is associated
with other hues, most glowing, yet of an indescribable
softness. I cannot imagine anything of this sort more
charming than the soft golden and orange hue upon the
green of the magnificent <i>Phan&aelig;us imperialis</i>.</p>

<p>Others again, as <i>Hoplia farinosa</i>, a little chafer from
Southern Europe, and many of the weevil tribe (<i>Curculionid&aelig;</i>),
are covered with scales of vivid splendour, but so
minute, and so closely set, that the whole surface reflects
one soft but rich lustre of tints, differing according to the
species. We would instance, of these, the noble species
of the genus <i>Cyphus</i>. Others of the same great family,
on a dark but still richly-coloured ground, have the
minute scales clustered in spots or bands, forming regular
patterns in much variety; and in these they reflect
rainbow hues, as if a sunbeam decomposed through a
prism had been solidified and pulverised; or if viewed
through a lens, looking like powdered gems, each individual
scale changing its hues with the slightest motion of
the eye. Among these we may mention <i>Hypsonotus elegans</i>,
<i>Cyphus spectabilis</i>, <i>Entimus splendidus</i>, and <i>E.
imperialis</i>, commonly known as diamond beetles; and the
elegantly-shaped genus <i>Pachyrhynchus</i>, of which the <i>P.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
<i>gemmatus</i>, from the Philippine Islands, is, perhaps, the
most lovely of all earthly creatures.</p>

<p>And if we look at the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the order more especially
under review, we feel that beauty belongs to them
rather as an essence than as an accident. Their broad
fan-like wings have an airy lightness and grace to which
the painter and the poet pay homage, when they endow
the sylphs and loves of their fancy with butterfly pinions.</p>

<p>They are clothed with minute scales, which are the
vehicle of their colours, somewhat resembling in this
respect the beetles last spoken of; but they have beauties
peculiar to themselves. Fine combinations and contrasts
of colours are too much the rule in this order to
need specification; and these are often shaded and blended
with a downy softness, as in the Sphinges and Moths.
As illustrious examples, I will mention the <i>Gynautocera</i>,
a group of Oriental Moths approaching in some points the
Butterflies, as exhibiting the most brilliant hues in bands
and clouds, but softly blended and mingled, with exceeding
chasteness and beauty.</p>

<p>Many species of the genus <i>Catagramma</i>, a group of
Butterflies marked on the inferior surface of the fore-wings
with scarlet and black, and on that of the hind with
singular concentric circles of black on a white ground,
have on the superior surface the metallic lustre common
in the beetles, the wings being of golden green or blue.
The genus <i>Urania</i> has this radiance still more conspicuous;
while the inferior surface of some of the <i>Thecl&aelig;</i>, as
<i>T. imperialis</i>, <i>T. Act&aelig;on</i>, <i>T. Endymion</i>, &amp;c., is covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
with the most rich and varied metallic hues, as if powdered
with gold, copper, and silver filings. Some Butterflies,
as several of our native <i>Fritillaries</i>, and more vividly
an American species, (<i>Argynnis passiflor&aelig;</i>,) one from
New Zealand, (<i>Argyrophenga antipodum</i>,) and the beautiful
<i>Paphia Clytemnestra</i>, have spots of burnished silver
on their inferior surface; and several of our own moths,
as the genus <i>Plusia</i>, are so spotted on the upper surface.
Others display a lustre between that of silver and that of
pearl, as several species of <i>Charaxes</i> on one, and the magnificent
<i>Morpho Laertes</i> on both surfaces. But of this
sort of beauty, perhaps nothing can excel the gemmeous
green, changing to azure, of <i>Papilio Ulysses</i>, or that of
<i>Apatura (?) laurentia</i>; or, above all, of some of the great
Brazilian <i>Morphos</i>. The blaze of silvery azure that
flashes from <i>M. Adonis</i>, <i>M. Cytheris</i>, and <i>M. Menelaus</i>,
is indescribable; the eyes are pained as they gaze upon it;
yet there is said to be an unnamed species from the
emerald mountains of Bogota, of which a single specimen
is in a private cabinet in London, which is far more lustrous
than these.</p>

<p>The change from one hue to another produced by the
play of light in altering the angle of its reflection, has always
been much admired; and this occurs in great perfection,
and with much diversity, in the lovely insects of the
<i>Lepidopterous</i> order.</p>

<p>Some of the genus <i>H&aelig;tera</i>, (as <i>H. piera</i>, and <i>H. esmeralda</i>,)
and many of the <i>Heliconiad&aelig;</i>, as <i>Hymenitis diaphana</i>,
&amp;c., have the wings nearly or quite destitute of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
ordinary scaly clothing, presenting only a transparent
membrane of great delicacy; over which the light plays
with a beautiful iridescence. <i>Papilio Arcturus</i> and some
allied species, are of a golden-green, changing to blue, or to
glowing purple. Very many of the <i>Nymphalid&aelig;</i> are distinguished
for a flush of surpassing richness, that in one
particular light gleams over the surface. Our own <i>Apatura
Iris</i>, commonly known as the purple emperor, is a
native example of this beauty, and still more <i>A. namoura</i>;
but especially the species of the genus <i>Thaumantis</i>, as
well as <i>Morpho Martia</i>, and <i>M. Automedon</i>. <i>Diadema
bolina</i> also displays a purple flush over and around the
white spots, which is exquisitely beautiful. In general
this glow is found only in the male, but in the lovely
<i>Epiphile chrysitis</i> it is common to the female.</p>

<p>In <i>Colias Electra</i> a warm purple glow plays over the
surface in a strong light, which is the more singularly
beautiful, because the permanent colour which is thus suffused
is a rich golden orange. There is, however, a species
(<i>C. Lesbia</i>) of which only a single specimen is known,
and that is in fragments, in the Banksian Collection, which
is in this respect vastly superior to the former. In all
these cases, the playing gleam is more or less empurpled;
in <i>Paphia Portia</i>, however, it may be called crimson.</p>

<p>But still more exquisitely beautiful than any of these is
the fine opalescence that irradiates some butterflies in the
changing beam. There is a white butterfly from Senegal
(<i>Anthocharis Ione</i>) allied to our common garden whites,
marked at the tips of the wings with a spot of violet, sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>rounded
by black. In a certain aspect, there plays over
this spot a violet opalescence of exceeding richness. And
to mention no more, (for, indeed, we know not that we
could mention anything to surpass this,) the carnation
spots on the black wings of <i>Papilio Anchises</i>, <i>P. &AElig;neas</i>,
<i>P. Tullus</i>, &amp;c., are at intervals flushed with a violet opalescence,
so brilliant, that we know no other object to compare
with it.</p>

<p>In contemplating such objects, we cannot help concurring
in the sentiments expressed by the pious Ray:&mdash;"Qu&aelig;ri
fortasse &agrave; nonnullis potest, quis Papilionum usus
sit? Respondeo, Ad ornatum universi, et ut hominibus
spectaculo sint: ad rura illustranda velut tot bracte&aelig;
inservientes. Quis enim eximiam earum pulchritudinem
et varietatem contemplans mira voluptate non afficiatur?
Quis tot colorum et schematum elegantias natur&aelig; ipsius
ingenio excogitatas et artifici penicillo depictas curiosis
oculis intuens, divin&aelig; artis vestigia eis impressa non
agnoscat et miretur?" And I may add, since such
exquisite traces of loveliness remain in a world which
Satan has spoiled and sin defiled, what must have been its
glory when He who made it could take complacency in
beholding it, and in the minutest details could pronounce
it "very good!"</p>

<p>The Rev. James Smith of Monquhitter thus alludes to
the exquisite beauty of some South American butterflies.
One or two of the species I have already alluded to, but
even these can yield additional themes of admiration. "I
hold," he says, "that there are hues and shades of colour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
which are positively beautiful in themselves, and independently
of all associations whatever; and to look upon
which merely as patches of colour, affords a gratification
of no mean description. And for the truth of such an
opinion, I know not where I should obtain a stronger and
a more pleasing proof, than from the <i>Lepidoptera</i> to
which I have alluded. The patch, for instance, which is
on the posterior wings of the <i>H&aelig;tera Esmeralda</i>, and
which may be characterised as a compound of carmine
and of the deepest blue dotted with two spots of vermilion,
will in itself, and irrespectively of association,
communicate a pleasure to every eye which looks upon it.
The band of silver blue on the wing of a large <i>Morpho</i>;
the deep tone, to speak in pictorial phrase, of the black in
the <i>Papilio Sesostris</i>, finer even than the finest velvet of
Genoa; the rich dark orange on <i>Epicilia Anc&aelig;a</i>; the
blue, shining in one unnamed species like polished steel,
in another (<i>Thecla</i>) with a radiant clearness, which ultramarine
itself could not surpass; the satin-like golden
green, the pearly lustrous white, and the deep shining
emerald ribbons in <i>Urania Boisduvalii</i>; the crimson
lines and spots deeper and clearer than blood, in a species
to which no name is attached, of <i>Papilio</i>; the small
spangles of silver with which the under surface of one of
the least among them (<i>Cupido</i>) is, as it were, incrusted;
the iridescent and delicate violet with which, on the same
surface, a particular species of <i>H&aelig;tera</i> is, so to speak,
washed over, in a way which calls to our remembrance
the 'scumbling' given by Rembrandt as the finishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
touch to his finest productions; all these, and many more,
possess a beauty which I contend, in opposition to the
doctrine of Alison and Jeffrey, is absolute in itself;
which is altogether irrespective of association; and which
the most skilful of human pencils would find it impossible
completely and properly to copy."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>I must apologise to fair readers for alluding to Spiders&mdash;"nasty
spiders!"&mdash;in a chapter on beauty; but prejudice
must not make us shut our eyes to glories even among
these. In the tropical species there is often metallic
splendour and brilliance of colour. In my "Naturalist's
Sojourn in Jamaica," my friend Mr Hill has written some
very interesting observations on the web of a certain
Spider, and on the relations of its structure with that of
the Spider itself; but I allude to it now because of the
elegance of the creature, the <i>Epeira argentata</i> of Fabricius.
The upper surface of the body is of a glistening
satiny or silvery whiteness, the belly yellow, spotted with
black, and the legs marked with alternate rings of the
same contrasted hues.</p>

<p>In the same island I was familiar with another species,
(<i>Nephila clavipes</i>,) remarkable for the length and strength
of its silken cords. The body, which is lengthened, is
studded with round white spots, each encircled with a
black border, on a rich greenish brown ground, reminding
one of the characteristic markings of the Tragopans
among birds. The cephalothorax is shining black, its
lustre half concealed by a clothing of short silvery down:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>the legs are very long, and have a remarkably elegant
appearance from having a bunch of black hair set around
the extremity of the first and second joints, like the
bristles of a bottle-brush.</p>

<p>I fortify my own verdict with the observations of a
brother naturalist on the Spiders of Borneo, presuming
that those which he alludes to appear to belong to the
genus <i>Gastracantha</i>, of which I have seen species in
Jamaica.</p>

<p>"The spiders, so disgusting in appearance in many
other countries, are here of quite a different nature, and are
the most beautiful of the insect tribe; they have a skin of
a shell-like texture, furnished with curious processes, in
some long, in others short, in some few, in others numerous;
but are found, of this description, only in thick
woods and shaded places: their colours are of every hue,
brilliant and metallic as the feathers of the humming-bird,
but are, unlike the bright colours of the beetle, totally
dependent on the life of the insect which they beautify,
so that it is impossible to preserve them."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>It is possible that this beauty might be less evanescent
if the animals were preserved in spirit or other antiseptic
fluid. A writer in the <i>Zoologist</i> (p. 5929) mentions the
fact that the iridescence of certain beetles (<i>Cassida</i>) which
is peculiarly splendid and metallic, and which disappears
immediately on the insects' becoming dry, is perpetuated
in its original loveliness when the specimens are preserved
in spirit, even after the lapse of several years.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>
<p>The tropical species of this genus are far finer and
richer than our little English kinds, though these are
pretty. I was much delighted by the brilliance of some
of the Jamaican species, and Sir Emerson Tennent thus
speaks of them in Ceylon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is one family of insects, the members of which
cannot fail to strike the traveller by their singular beauty,
the <i>Cassidad&aelig;</i>, or tortoise beetles, in which the outer
shell overlaps the body, and the limbs are susceptible of
being drawn entirely within it. The rim is frequently of
a different tint from the centre, and one species which I
have seen is quite startling from the brilliancy of its colouring,
which gives it the appearance of a ruby inclosed
in a frame of pearl; but this wonderful effect disappears
immediately on the death of the insect."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>If we turn to the vegetable world, what a profusion of
beauty do we find! Exquisite are the tiny Mosses, when
the fogs and rains of winter, so inimical to other vegetation,
have quickened them into verdure and fruit. How
they spread along the hedgerow banks in soft fleeces of
vivid emerald, and shoot up their slender stalks, each
crowned with its tiny urn, and wearing its fairy nightcap!
Beautiful are the tiny dark-green feather-like leaves
of the Forkmoss crowded on the clayey bank; beautiful
the wild sprays of the plumy Hypnum; and beautiful the
little round velvet cushions of Tortula, that grow on every
old wall-top.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The tiny moss, whose silken verdure clothes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time-worn rock, and whose bright capsules rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like fairy urns, on stalks of golden sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demand our admiration and our praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As much as cedar kissing the blue sky<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And what <i>He</i> deigns to make should ne'er be deem'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unworthy of our study."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Exquisite too are the Ferns, in their arching fronds, so
richly cut in elegant tracery. See a fine crown of the
Lady Fern in a shaded Devonshire lane, and confess
that grace and beauty are triumphant there. And in the
saturated atmosphere of the tropical islands, where these
lovely plants form a very large proportion of the entire
vegetation, and some of them rise on slender stems thirty
or forty feet in altitude, from the summit of which the
wide-spreading fronds arch gracefully on every side, like
a vast umbrella of twinkling verdure, through whose filagree
work the sunbeams are sparkling,&mdash;what can be
more charming than Ferns?</p>

<p>The queenly Palms, too, are models of stately beauty.
Linn&aelig;us called them <i>vegetabilium principes</i>; and, when
we see them in some noble conservatory of adequate dimensions,
such as the glass palm-house at Kew, crowded
side by side, with their crowned heads, and lofty stature,
and proud, erect bearing, we are involuntarily reminded
of the monarchs of many kingdoms met in august conclave.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lo! higher still the stately palm-trees rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Chequering the clouds with their unbending stems,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span><span class="i0">And o'er the clouds, amid the dark-blue skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lifting their rich unfading diadems.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How calm and placidly they rest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the heaven's indulgent breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if their branches never breeze had known!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And Silence, 'mid their lofty bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits on her moveless throne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Are the Grasses worthy of mention for their beauty?
Surely, yes. Many of them display a downy lightness exquisitely
lovely, as the common Feather-grass. The golden
panicles of the great Quake-grass, so curiously compacted
and hanging in stalks of so hair-like a tenuity as to nod
and tremble with the slightest motion, how beautiful are
these! And the satiny plumes of the Pampas-grass projecting
from the clump of leaves form a fine object. But
the Bamboos, those great arborescent Grasses of the tropics,
form a characteristic feature of the vegetation of those
regions, of almost unexampled magnificence. I have seen
them in their glory, and can sympathise with the philosophical
Humboldt in the powerful effect which the
grandeur of the Bamboo produces on the poetic mind.
It is an object never to be forgotten, especially when
growing in those isolated clumps, that look like tufts of
ostrich-plumes magnified to colossal dimensions. A
thousand of these noble reeds standing in close array,
each four or five inches in the diameter of its stem, and
rising in erect dignity to the height of forty feet, and all
waving their tufted summits in diverging curves moved
by every breeze,&mdash;form, indeed, a magnificent spectacle.
Growing in the most rocky situations, the Bamboo is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
frequently planted in Jamaica on the very apex of those
conical hills which form so remarkable a feature in the
landscape of the interior, and to which its noble tufts
constitute a most becoming crown.</p>

<p>Mr Ellis thus describes the elegance of these magnificent
Grasses in Madagascar:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The base of the hills and the valleys were covered
with the Bamboo, which was far more abundant than
during any former part of the journey. There were at
least four distinct varieties: one a large growing kind,
erect nearly to the point; a second smaller, seldom rising
much above twenty feet in height, bushy at the base, and
gracefully bending down its tapering point. A third kind
rose in single cane, almost without a leaf, to the height of
thirty feet or more; or, bending over, formed a perfectly
circular arch. I also saw a Bamboo growing as a creeper,
with small short joints, feathered with slender leafy
branches at every joint, and stretching in festoons from tree
to tree along the side of the road, or hanging suspended in
single lines from a projecting branch, and swinging gently
with the passing breeze. The appearance of the Bamboo
when growing is exceedingly graceful. Sometimes the
canes, as thick as a man's arm at the base, rise forty or
fifty feet high, fringed at the joints, which are two or
three feet apart, with short branches of long, lance-shaped
leaves. The smaller kinds, which abound most in this
region, are still more elegant; and the waving of the
canes, with their attenuated but feathery-looking points,
bending down like a plume, and the tremulous quivering,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
even in the slightest breeze, of their long, slender leaves,
present ever-varying aspects of beauty; and, combined
with the bright-green colour of the Bamboo-cane and leaf,
impart an indescribable charm to the entire landscape."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Glorious in loveliness are the <i>Musace&aelig;</i>, the Plantains
and Bananas of the hot regions. Humboldt calls the
Banana "one of the noblest and most lovely of vegetable
productions;" and truly its enormous, flag-like leaves of
the richest green, permeated by nervures running transversely
in exactly parallel lines, and arching out in every
direction from the succulent, spongy, sheathed stem, command
our admiration, apart from the beauty of their
flowers, or the importance of their fruit.</p>

<p>In a description of a mountain scene in Tahiti, drawn
with graphic power by Charles Darwin, the Banana forms
a prominent element:&mdash;"I could not look on the surrounding
plants without admiration. On every side were forests
of Banana; the fruit of which, though serving for food in
various ways, lay in heaps decaying on the ground....
As the evening drew to a close, I strolled beneath the
gloomy shade of the Bananas up the course of the stream.
My walk was soon brought to a close, by coming to a
waterfall between two and three hundred feet high; and
again above this there was another.... In the little recess
where the water fell, it did not appear that a breath
of wind had ever blown. The thin edges of the great
leaves of the Banana, damp with spray, were unbroken,
instead of being, as is so generally the case, split into a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>thousand shreds. From our position, almost suspended
on the mountain-side, there were glimpses into the depths
of the neighbouring valleys: and the lofty points of the
central mountains, towering up within sixty degrees of the
zenith, hid half the evening sky. Thus seated, it was a
sublime spectacle to watch the shades of night gradually
obscuring the last and highest pinnacles."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>This scene must have been one of surpassing sublimity
and loveliness. Few doubtless have ever beheld anything
that can be compared with it. But perhaps many have
felt&mdash;I have, often,&mdash;that there are occasions in which
the sense of the beautiful in nature becomes almost painfully
overpowering. I have gazed on some very lovely
prospects, bathed perhaps in the last rays of the evening
sun, till my soul seemed to struggle with a very peculiar
undefinable sensation, as if longing for a power to enjoy,
which I was conscious I did not possess, and which found
relief only in tears. I have felt conscious that there were
elements of enjoyment and admiration there, which went
far beyond my capacity of enjoying and admiring; and I
have delighted to believe, that, by and by, when, in the
millennial kingdom of Jesus, and, still more, in the
remoter future, in the dispensation of the fulness of times,
the earth&mdash;the "<i>new</i> earth,"&mdash;shall be endowed with a
more than paradisaical glory, there will be given to
redeemed man a greatly increased power and capacity for
drinking in, and enjoying the augmented loveliness.
Doubtless the risen and glorified saints, sitting with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>King of kings upon His throne, will have the senses of
their spiritual bodies expanded in capacity beyond what
we can now form the slightest conception of; and as all
then will be enjoyment of the most exquisite kind, and
absolutely unalloyed by interruption or satiety,&mdash;the eye
will at length be satisfied with seeing, and the ear be
satisfied with hearing. "<i>I shall be satisfied</i>, when I
awake up with thy likeness."</p>

<p>It is in <i>Flowers</i> that the beauty of the vegetable world
chiefly resides; and I shall now therefore select a few
examples from the profusion of lovely objects which the
domain proper of Flora presents to us.</p>

<p>That very curious tribe of plants, the <i>Orchide&aelig;</i>, so
remarkable for the mimic forms of other things, that its
blossoms delight to assume, is also pre-eminent in gorgeous
beauty. Take the <i>Sobrali&aelig;</i>,&mdash;terrestrial species
from Central America, where they form extensive thickets,
growing thrice the height of man, with slender nodding
stems, and alternate willow-like leaves, and terminal
racemes loaded with snow-white, pink, crimson, or violet
flowers.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Imagine the crushing through "thickets" of
the lovely <i>S. macrantha</i>! The large lily-like blossoms
of this species are eight inches long, and as many wide,
of the richest purple crimson, and of the most elegant
shape conceivable, with the lip so wrapped round the
column as to appear funnel-shaped, bordered by an exquisitely-cut
fringe.</p>

<p>I have before alluded to <i>Phajus Tankervilli&aelig;</i>, that rich
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>lily-like spike of blossom which I stumbled on in the
midst of a dense thicket in the mountains of Jamaica.
Another terrestrial genus of great elegance is <i>Cypripedium</i>,
of which we have one native species, <i>C. calceolus</i>, the
yellow lady's slipper,&mdash;one of the most charming, but the
rarest and most difficult of propagation, of British plants.
But this is far excelled in beauty by many of the exotic
species; as, for example, the exquisite <i>C. barbatum</i> from
Malacca. The very foliage is princely; for the nervures
and cross-veins form a network pattern of dark green
upon the light green area of each broad leaf. The blossom
rears up its noble head erect, with its standard-petal of
white, striped with green and purple, the wing-petals
studded with purple tubercles along their edges, and the
lip or slipper-shaped petal of a dark purple hue.</p>

<p>My readers may have occasionally noticed a little plant,
in the most recherch&eacute;es stove-houses, of so much delicacy
and preciousness that it is invariably kept under a bell-glass.
I mean the <i>An&aelig;ctochilus setaceus</i>. It belongs to
this tribe, and is a terrestrial species, growing about the
roots of the trees in the humid forests of Ceylon. Its
exquisite loveliness has attracted the attention of even the
apathetic Cingalese, who call it by the poetical epithet of
<i>Wanna Raja</i>, or king of the forest. It does not appear
to possess any peculiar attractiveness in its blossoms,&mdash;indeed,
I have never seen it in flower; but its leaves,
which grow in opposite pairs, are elegantly heart-shaped,
of a deep rich greenish-brown hue, approaching to black,
of a surface which resembles velvet, reticulated all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
with pale golden veins, which, being numerous and minute,
have a very charming appearance, somewhat like the pale
network on black patches which we see in the wings of
some dragon-flies.</p>

<p>The epiphyte Orchids are also magnificent in beauty.
One of the handsomest genera is <i>Dendrobium</i>, containing
many species, mostly natives of Southern Asia
and the great islands. Perhaps the finest of all is <i>D.
nobile</i>, of which the sepals and petals are greenish-white,
tipped with rich purple, and the downy tube-like lip is of
the same regal hue in the interior, with a pale yellow
margin.</p>

<p>By the side of this you may set the lovely <i>Huntleya
violacea</i>, one of the discoveries of Sir R. Schomburgk in
the interior of Guiana. Its broad wavy petals of the
softest richest violet, "vary in intensity from deepest
sapphire to the mild iridescence of opal." This fine
flower has a melancholy interest from its being associated
with the death of Sir Robert's friend and fellow-servant,
Mr Reiss. The gorgeous scenes of tropical
vegetation in which the plant was found, and the sad accident,
are thus depicted by the accomplished traveller:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I discovered the <i>Huntleya violacea</i> for the first time
in October 1837, then on my ascent of the river Essequibo.
The large cataract, Cumaka Toto, or Silk Cotton
Fall, obliged us to unload our corials, and to transport
the luggage overland, in order to avoid the dangers which
a mass of water, at once so powerful and rapid, and
bounded by numerous rocks, might offer to our ascent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
While the Indians were thus occupied, I rambled about
one of the small islands, which the diverging arms of the
river formed in their descent, and the vegetation of which
had that peculiar lively appearance which is so characteristic
of the vicinity of cataracts, where a humid cloud,
the effects of the spray, always hovers around them.
Blocks of syenite were heaped together; and while their
black shining surface contrasted strongly with the whitish
foam of the torrent, and with the curly waves beating
against the rocky barriers&mdash;as if angry at the boundary
which they attempted to set to the incensed element&mdash;their
dome-shaped summits were adorned with a vegetation
at once rich and interesting. <i>Heliconias</i>, <i>Tillandsias</i>,
<i>Bromelias</i>, <i>Ferns</i>, <i>Pothos</i>, <i>Cyrtopodiums</i>, <i>Epidendrums</i>,
<i>Peperomias</i>, all appeared to struggle for the place
which so small a surface afforded to them. The lofty
mountains, Akaywanna, Comute, or Taquia, and Tuasinki,
recede and form an amphitheatre, affording a highly interesting
scene, and no doubt the most picturesque of that
part of the river Essequibo.</p>

<p>"I was attracted by a number of <i>Oncidium altissimum</i>
which covered one of the rocky piles, and astonished me
by their long stems and bright colour of their flowers,
when my attention was more powerfully attracted by a
plant, the appearance of which, although different from
the pseudo-bulbous tribe, proclaimed, nevertheless, that
it belonged to that interesting family, the <i>Orchide&aelig;</i>. The
specimens were numerous; and clothed almost, with their
vivid green, the rugged and dark trunks of the gigantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
trees, which contributed to the majestic scene around me.
It was not long before I discovered one of these plants in
flower. It was as singular as it was new to me;&mdash;the
sepals and petals of a rich purple and velvet-like appearance;
the helmet, to which form the column bore
the nearest resemblance, of the same colour; the labellum
striated with yellow.</p>

<p>"In the sequel of my expeditions, I found it generally in
the vicinity of cataracts, where a humid vapour is constantly
suspended, and where the rays of the sun are
scarcely admitted through a thick canopy of foliage. I
traced the <i>Huntleya</i> from the sixth parallel of latitude to
the shady mountains of the Acaria chain near the equator;
but in its fullest splendour it appeared at one of the
small islands among the Christmas cataracts in the river
Berbice. There is a melancholy circumstance connected
with the plant, which its appearance never fails to recall
to my memory. Their singular beauty at this spot induced
my friend, Mr Reiss, who accompanied me as a
volunteer during the unfortunate expedition up the river
Berbice, to draw and paint it on the spot. He was yet
occupied with this task when the last of our canoes was
to descend the dangerous cataract. He arose from his
occupation, desirous to descend with the Indians in the
canoe, although against my wish, but he persisted. The
canoe approached the fall; it upset; and, of thirteen
persons who were in it at the time, he was the only one
who paid the rash attempt with his life. He is now
buried opposite that island, the richest vegetable pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>ductions
of which it was his last occupation to imitate on
paper and in colours."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>We might linger long on these flowers of strange loveliness,
but space compels us to forsake them and to turn
to some other examples in the wide range of Flora's
domains. How glorious a sight must be the sheeted
Rhododendrons of the Himalaya peaks, on whose lofty
elevations Dr Hooker found these fine plants in great
prominence, "clothing the mountain-slopes with a deep-green
mantle, glowing with bells of brilliant colours; of
the eight or ten species growing here, [on the Zemir, in
Sikkim, twelve thousand feet above the sea,] every bush
was loaded with as great a profusion of blossoms as are
their northern congeners in our English gardens!"<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>The noblest of the genus is that which is dedicated to
Lady Dalhousie. It is an epiphyte, being always found
growing, like the Orchids, among mosses and ferns, upon
the trunks of large trees, especially oaks and magnolias,
at an elevation of from seven to ten thousand feet. In
this particular, in the fragrance of its noble white blossoms,
in its slender habit, in the whorled arrangement of
its branches, and in the length of time during which it
continues in flower in its native regions, viz., from April
to July, it differs from all its fellows of the same genus
that inhabit northern India.</p>

<p>The flowers are four inches in length and four in
diameter, with a broad trumpet lip. Their colour is pure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>white, assuming a delicate rosy tinge as they become old,
and sometimes becoming spotted with orange. They have
an odour which resembles that of the lemon.</p>

<p>Of this and the following species Dr Hooker writes from
Dorjiling, seven thousand feet above the sea:&mdash;"On the
branches of the immense purple-flowered magnolia, (<i>M.
Campbellii</i>,) and those of oaks and laurels, <i>Rhododendron
Dalhousi&aelig;</i> grows epiphytally, a slender shrub bearing
from three to six white lemon-scented bells, four and a
half inches long and so many broad, at the end of each
branch. In the same woods the scarlet Rhododendron
(<i>R. arboreum</i>) is very scarce, and is outvied by the great
<i>R. argenteum</i>, which grows as a tree, forty feet high,
with magnificent leaves twelve to fifteen inches long, deep
green wrinkled above and silvery below, while the flowers
are as large as those of <i>R. Dalhousi&aelig;</i> and grow more in
a cluster. I know nothing of the kind that exceeds in
beauty the flowering branch of <i>R. argenteum</i>, with its
wide-spreading foliage and glorious mass of flowers."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The latter, which is nearly equal to <i>R. Dalhousi&aelig;</i> in
the size of its blossoms, and perhaps superior to it in
other respects, is another white-flowered species. It is, as
described above, a tree with large massive leaves of a
silvery tint beneath. When young, they are exquisitely
beautiful, being encased in long flesh-coloured cones of
large scales, of very ornamental appearance. The flowers
are three inches long, forming a compact globose head.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>
<p>They secrete a large quantity of honey, which is said to
be poisonous, as is also that of <i>R. Dalhousi&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The grandeur and beauty of the same genus are celebrated
by Mr Low, as he saw the species growing in
Borneo, where too their parasitic character struck him, as
it had done Dr Hooker:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps the most gorgeous of the native plants are
the various species of the genus <i>Rhododendron</i>, which
here assume a peculiar form, being found epiphytal upon
the trunks of trees, as the genera of the tribe <i>Orchidace&oelig;</i>.
This habit, induced probably by the excessive moisture of
the climate, is not, however, confined to the Ericaceous
plants, but also prevails with the genera <i>Fagria</i>, <i>Combretum</i>,
and many others, usually terrestrial; the roots of
the Rhododendrons, instead of being, as with the species
[which are] inhabitants of cold climates, small and fibrous,
become large and fleshy, winding round the trunks of
the forest trees; the most beautiful one is that which
I have named in compliment to Mr Brooke. Its large
heads of flowers are produced in the greatest abundance
throughout the year: they much exceed in size those of
any known species, frequently being formed of eighteen
flowers, which are of all shades, from pale and rich
yellow to a rich reddish salmon-colour; in the sun, the
flowers sparkle with a brilliancy resembling that of gold
dust.</p>

<p>"Four other species which I discovered are very
gorgeous, but of different colours, one being crimson and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
another red, and the third a rich tint between these two:
of the fourth I have not yet seen the flowers."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Take an example from another order. The Lightning-tree
of Madagascar rises before us in the graphic pages
of Mr Ellis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But the most magnificent objects were the fine trees
of <i>Astrap&aelig;a Wallichii</i>, or <i>viscosa</i>. The name of this
Malagasy plant was derived from the word for lightning,
on account of the brilliancy of its flowers; and Sir Joseph
Paxton and Dr Lindley have thus spoken of <i>A. Wallichii</i>:&mdash;'One
of the finest plants ever introduced. And when
loaded with its magnificent flowers, we think nothing can
exceed its grandeur.' I had seen a good-sized plant growing
freely at Mauritius, but here it was in its native
home, luxuriating on the banks of the stream, its trunk
a foot in diameter, its broad-leaved branches stretching
over the water, and its large, pink, globular, composite<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
flowers, three or four inches in diameter, suspended at
the end of a fine down-covered stalk, nine inches or a foot
in length. These, hanging by hundreds along the course
of the stream, surpassed anything of the kind I had seen,
or could possibly have imagined. I frequently met with
the <i>Astrap&aelig;a</i> afterwards, but always growing near the
water, and its branches frequently stretching over a lake
or river."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p><p>The Leguminous or Papilionaceous order presents many
plants of striking beauty, both in foliage, which is often
of extreme lightness and elegance, and also in blossom.
They are among the gayest and most graceful of plants in
all regions. The magnificent vegetation of the Mauritius
contains one of notable glory, the Flamboyant, thus noticed
by Ellis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Conspicuous beyond all the rest is the stately and gorgeous
<i>Poinciana regia</i>, compact-growing and regular in
form, but retaining something of the acacia habit, rising
sometimes to the height of forty or fifty feet, and, between
the months of December and April, presenting, amidst its
delicate pea-green pinnated leaves, one vast pyramid of
bunches of bright, dazzling scarlet flowers. Seen sometimes
over the tops of the houses, and at others in an
open space, standing forth in truly regal splendour, this
is certainly one of the most magnificent of trees. Its
common name is <i>mille fleurs</i>, or <i>flamboyant</i>."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>I have had the delight of seeing the <i>Poinciana pulcherrima</i>
in Jamaica, where it goes by the name of
Flower-feuce, or sometimes, the "Pride of Barbadoes."
It is, when in flower, a gorgeous mass of scarlet and
orange, and it seemed to me the most magnificent thing
in its way, that I had ever seen. It does not, however,
attain the dimensions of its antipode, rarely exceeding
those of a large shrub.</p>

<p>I know not what the Burmese tree is, which is alluded
to in the following extracts from letters which I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>received from my esteemed friend, Captain G. E. Bulger,
of the 10th Regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall be exceedingly obliged by your telling me
whether you are familiar with the tree known in the
West Indies and South America as the 'Bois Immortel;'
and whether you think the leaf herewith sent belongs to
it.</p>

<p>"During the cool season in Burmah, the forest presents
a gorgeous sight, from the multitude of scarlet blossoms
which a large kind of tree puts forth; and I am strongly
inclined to think that this splendid ornament of the
jungles is, at all events, allied to the Bois Immortel of the
Western World.</p>

<p>"The tree I speak of begins to flower about the middle
of December, at which time the leaves commence to
wither and drop off. By the end of January, when it is
in full bloom, there is hardly a leaf remaining, but it
continues one mass of scarlet blossom until March. The
flower is shaped like that of the pea.</p>

<p>"If you can enlighten me on this point I shall be
indeed very much obliged."</p>

<p>I was compelled to confess my ignorance even of the
South American beauty, and my friend thus replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I first read of the 'Bois Immortel' in 'Waterton's
Wanderings,' and I subsequently saw a coloured representation
of the tree in Mr Gould's magnificent work on
Humming-Birds. I think the specific name was also
given in that work, but it is some time ago, and I have
almost forgotten what it was like. Since I saw these two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
works, I have heard officers speak of the splendour of the
South American forests during the season of 'Le Bois
Immortel,' and have heard more than one say that they
believed nothing on earth could be more magnificent than
'matchless Trinidad' when these trees are in full bloom.
The autumnal beauty of the North American woods is,
doubtless, familiar to you, and I question very much
whether there is anything richer or more lovely to be
found even in South America."</p>

<p>Even the humblest orders of plants have the element of
beauty bestowed on them with no niggard hand. Who
would have expected, among the <i>Chenopode&aelig;</i>, and, above
all, in the lowly little Saltworts, to find such a glowing
scene as Mr Atkinson describes?&mdash;</p>

<p>"We were now on a heavy sandy steppe&mdash;part of the
Sackha Desert, which extends into the Gobi&mdash;and vegetation
was so very scant, that even the steppe grass had
disappeared. The <i>Salsola</i> was growing in a broad belt
around the small salt lakes, its colour varying from orange
to the deepest crimson. These lakes have a most singular
appearance when seen at a distance. The sparkling of
the crystallised salt, which often reflected the deep crimson
around, gave them the appearance of diamonds and
rubies set in a gorgeous framework. I rode round several
times, admiring their beauty, and regretting that it was
impossible to stay and visit a large lake, which I observed,
ten or fifteen versts distant, surrounded with green, orange,
and crimson."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>
<p>The microscope, too, will bring out beauties in flowers
which the unassisted eye is incompetent fully to recognise.
If we take a scarlet Geranium, or a purple Heartsease,
the eye is delighted with the brilliancy of the colouring;
but on placing a petal of either on a slip of glass, under a
pretty high magnifying power, and reflecting the full
rays of the sun through the object, the rich gorgeousness
of the hue, the sparkling gem-like radiance of the surface,
and the exquisitely-regular form of the round cells, with
their clear interstices, form a spectacle of glorious beauty
that almost surpasses the conception of one who has not
seen it.</p>

<p>I shall close this chapter, which might easily have been
expanded into a volume, with a reference to an humble
and minute plant, whose fairy loveliness, combined with
an almost unkillable hardiness of constitution, has won
for it a place in every garden, however unpretending, and
however ungenial in its locality,&mdash;the London-pride. This
exquisite little Saxifrage, general favourite as it is, requires
the microscope to bring out its beauties to advantage, but
under a good instrument you cannot fail to be charmed
with it. I have one before me at this moment, and will
describe what I see.</p>

<p>First, I notice, on a cursory glance, that the whole
plant is clothed with tiny hairs; I take one of the flower-stalks
and examine these with a power of three hundred
diameters. Each now becomes a stem of glass-like clearness,
tapering upwards to a point, where it bears a richly
crimson cup, and in this is seated a globule of colourless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
glass, just as an acorn sits in its shell. The multitude of
these organs&mdash;glandular hairs, the botanist calls them&mdash;standing
up side by side, rising to varying heights, and
displaying various degrees of development, is a very pleasing
sight.</p>

<p>I turn to an unopened bud, putting on a lower power,
and viewing it as an opaque object, with reflected light by
the aid of the Lieberkuhn. Here are the parting sepals
of the calyx, painted with rose-pink and pea-green, and
studded all over with the knobbed hairs just noticed; the
coloured surface is rough with granules, but it is the
roughness of glass, for every knob gleams and sparkles with
light. The corolla, a little white ball, displays its petals
smoothly folded over each other, and their surface has the
same appearance of granular glass as that of the calyx.</p>

<p>But now let me examine this blossom just expanded
this morning,&mdash;the very first of the season, by the way.
I must have a low power for this, eighty diameters, or so.
Oh, how exquisite! The little saucer of five oval petals,
each of snowy whiteness, bearing its bow of lovely crimson
specks, with a spot of gamboge-yellow for the chord,
and the whole sparkling with glassy points as before.
The pale red germen in the centre, rising into two points
of snow, their rosy tips pressed close together, as if the
twins were kissing. The ten stamens, five short alternating
with five long ones, and each bearing its pretty
kidney-shaped anther of pale scarlet. No; all are not
kidney-shaped; for here is one which has burst, and the
grains of red pollen are seen covering its rough purple sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>face;
and here is one stamen from the point of which the
anther has gone, leaving only two or three pollen-grains
adhering. Behind all, I see the sepals of the calyx, peeping
out between the petals, and forming a fine dark background
for them, and for the longer filaments.</p>

<p>And now I say to my readers, one and all,&mdash;you may
not have the opportunity to examine the glorious tropical
Orchids, or the gorgeous Flamboyant, but go and pluck a
flower of the London-pride, and you will have before your
eyes such a production of Divine handiwork as may well
excite the admiration and adoration of an angel.</p>

<h2>PARASITES.</h2>


<p>Vast as is this round world on which we live, its surface
is not nearly large enough for all the living creatures
which are ordained to inhabit it. Multitudes of animals
do not walk on the ground, or swim in the waters, or fly
in the air, but find the scene of their abode on or in the
bodies of other animals. Multitudes of plants do not
grow out of the soil, but attach themselves to other plants,
and draw their sustenance and support thence. Nay,
there are parasites upon parasites, and this, according to
Hood, in an infinitely descending series.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Great fleas have little fleas<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon their backs to bite 'em;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little fleas have lesser fleas;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so <i>ad infinitum</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps the poet's imagination ran a little ahead of his
science here; but the idea of an <i>infinite</i> succession of
parasites, like nests of pill-boxes, is surely a funny one.
There is nothing funny, however, in the thought "that
even man," who was made in the image of God, "bears
about in his vital organs various forms of loathsome
creatures, which riot on his fluids, and consume the very
substance of his tissues while ensconced where no efforts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
his can dislodge them, no application destroy them. So
it is; and few physical facts are better calculated to humble
man, and stain the pride of his glory, than to feel that
he may at any moment be nourishing a horrid tape-worm
in his alimentary canal, or that his muscles may be filled
with millions of microscopic <i>trichin&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>I will not dwell on these; though, if I were writing a
book of pure science, there is a wondrous array of facts of
the most striking and interesting character, connected
with the structure, the metamorphoses, and the habits, of
the Entozoic Worms, which I might present to my
readers. It is more pleasant to consider other facts,
perhaps not less marvellous, which, as they do not come
quite so home to our personal feelings, will not excite
horror and disgust in our minds.</p>

<p>The <i>economy</i> of creation is remarkable. He who, by
His divine manipulation converted five loaves and two
small fishes into a hearty meal for five thousand men,
besides women and children, and who could, with the
same ease have made them a hundred times as much,
said, when the meal was over, "Gather up the fragments,
that nothing be lost." And, when He spread the earth
with life, though His resources were infinite, He ordained
that one object, itself healthfully enjoying life, and fulfilling
its own proper ends of being, should be a microcosm,
on which another range of life should find its
sphere, and on which it should disport, as on an independent
world. I have often admired, in the gorgeous
tropical forests, what a wilderness of vegetation a single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
tree supports; what numbers of orchids and wild pines
spring out of the forks, what creepers and lianes hang
and twine about its branches, what elegant ferns cluster
on the horizontal limbs, what snake-like cacti creep from
bough to bough, what mosses, and jungermanni&aelig; crowd in
every crevice, what many-coloured lichens stud the rugged
bark! And then animal life is swarming in all this great
field of parasitic vegetation. Reptiles and birds, snails
and slugs, insects and millepedes, and spiders and worms
nestle by thousands in such prolific situations, so that a
great old tropical tree, one of the giant figs or cotton-trees,
is a very museum in itself.</p>

<p>And in my wanderings along the sea-edge here at home
how often have I been amazed at the diverse population,
plant and animal, which crowds a single oar-weed, or
tangle! The stem fringed with delicate red-weeds, as the
minute <i>Rhodymeni&aelig;</i>, and <i>Polysyphoni&aelig;</i>, and <i>Callithamnia</i>;
the tortuous roots studded with Anemones, with
<i>Flustr&aelig;</i> and <i>Leprali&aelig;</i>, and multitudes of other <i>Polyzoa</i>,
with tiny Polypes of many kinds, with Barnacles and
Limpets, and sheltering small Crustacea, and Mites, and
Annelids by scores.</p>

<p>Mr Darwin has an interesting passage on this subject,
evoked by the profusion of parasitic life on the long sea-weed
of Cape Horn (<i>Macrocystis</i>). "The number of
living creatures" he remarks, "whose existence intimately
depends on the Kelp is wonderful. A great volume might
be written, describing the inhabitants of one of these beds
of sea-weed. Almost all the leaves, excepting those that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
float on the surface, are so thickly incrusted with corallines
as to be of a white colour. We find exquisitely
delicate structures, some inhabited by simple hydra-like
polypi, others by more organised kinds, and
beautiful compound Ascidi&aelig;. On the leaves also,
various patelliform shells, Trochi, uncovered molluscs,
and some bivalves are attached. Innumerable crustacea
frequent every part of the plant. On shaking the great
entangled roots, a pile of small fish, shells, cuttle-fish,
crabs of all orders, sea-eggs, star-fish, beautiful Holuthuri&aelig;,
Planari&aelig;, and crawling nereidous animals of a
multitude of forms, all fall out together. Often as I recurred
to a branch of the kelp, I never failed to discover
animals of new and curious structure. In Chiloe, where
the kelp does not thrive very well, the numerous shells,
corallines, and crustacea are absent; but there yet remain
a few of the Flustrace&aelig;, and some compound Ascidi&aelig;;
the latter, however, are of different species from those in
Terra del Fuego: we here see the fucus possessing a wider
range than the animals which use it as an abode. I can
only compare these great aquatic forests of the southern
hemisphere, with the terrestrial ones in the intertropical
regions.</p>

<p>"Yet if in any country a forest was destroyed, I do not
believe nearly so many species of animals would perish as
would here, from the destruction of the kelp. Amidst
the leaves of this plant numerous species of fish live,
which nowhere else could find food or shelter: with their
destruction the many cormorants and other fishing birds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
the otters, seals, and porpoises, would soon perish also;
and lastly, the Fuegian savage, the miserable lord of this
miserable land, would redouble his cannibal feast, decrease
in numbers, and perhaps cease to exist."</p>

<p>I have alluded to the epiphytic plants which are so
abundant in the tropics, and which add so greatly to the
gorgeousness of the forests there. The most remarkable,
or, at all events, the best known, of these are the <i>Orchide&aelig;</i>,
to which, as I have already had occasion more than once
to speak of them, I shall do little more than refer here.
These establish themselves in the forks, upon the greater
limbs, and even in the roughnesses of the bark of the
trunk, adhering by their long, interlaced roots, which look
like knotted whip-cord, and forming their bunches of
psuedo-bulbs, whence their succulent, thick, but elegant
leaves project,&mdash;a great tuft of verdure; and their fantastic
flower-scapes wave in the air or droop with their weight
of gorgeous bloom. Thus they derive their nourishment
from the humid atmosphere alone, being dependent on the
friendly tree only for support and elevation. Humidity
seems essential to the vigour of these and most other
forms of parasitic vegetation. In the deep shady, gloomy
forests of Java, which constitute the zone of vegetation
around the base of the mountains, these plants abound,
where the air is heavy and damp with the vapours that
cannot ascend, and where the density of the foliage is
almost frightful; where heat, moisture, and a most extraordinarily
deep and rich vegetable soil combine to produce
wood of a fungus-like softness, and an inconceivable abund<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>ance
of twining plants and epiphytes. In those forests,
more especially where huge fig-trees constitute the principal
part of the timber, intermingled with the most
tropical forms of vegetation, such as <i>Sterculiace&aelig;</i>, <i>Sapindace&aelig;</i>,
and <i>Artocarpe&aelig;</i>, tufts of <i>Orchide&aelig;</i> attain a vast
size and luxuriance, in company with Aroideous and
Zinziberaceous plants.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> In Demerara, Mr Henchman
found masses of <i>Oncidium altissimum</i> and <i>Maxillaria
Parkeri</i> of wide dimensions, and so densely growing as to
defy any attempt at intrusion; and on the Spanish main
he saw the <i>Epidendrum</i> known as the "Spread Eagle"
clasping enormous trees, and covering them from the top
to the bottom.</p>

<p>The fig-trees, which are among the most gigantic of the
tropical forest-trees, and which support an immense profusion
of epiphytes, are themselves frequently parasitic
and epiphyte in their early condition. It is not uncommon
in Jamaica to see a network of roots partially
embracing the trunk of some great tree, far up its
column, and gradually creeping round and downward. I
have seen an old wall so covered, presenting a very curious
spectacle. The roots of a wide-spreading fig growing out
of the summit of the wall, had spread over its perpendicular
surface, down to the earth, all in the same plane,
clinging to the wall; the chief roots were as thick as a
man's leg, but subordinate roots had proceeded from one to
another, anastomosing in all directions (if I may use
such a term), so as to make a most elaborate network of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
a multitude of meshes of various angular forms and sizes.
These cross-roots were <i>at each extremity</i> united with the
larger roots, and looked as if the whole network had been
skilfully carved out of one solid plank of wood, by cutting
out the areas or meshes, and rounding the component
bars; the very bark that covered the whole was continuous,
where the roots united, as if they had been always integrally
one.</p>

<p>The only mode in which I can account for this singular
phenomenon is the following hypothesis:&mdash;The seed of
the tree was originally deposited on the summit of the
wall, beneath the eaves. As it germinated, the roots ran
down towards the earth, some perpendicularly, some
diagonally; but all creeping along the surface of the
wall, no roots having shot out from its perpendicular.
As these roots increased, they sent out side rootlets,
which, still running on the face of the wall, by and by
came in contact with another of the primary roots.
Then, instead of creeping <i>over</i> it, as the roots of other
trees would have done, the soft tip of the rootlet actually
united with the substance of the root at the point of contact,
the fibres of the two becoming interlaced, and their
united surfaces gradually becoming covered with a common
bark. The repetition of this process had produced
the very curious wooden net which I have attempted to
describe.</p>

<p>A still more remarkable example of this parasitic mode
of growth I have seen in the same island. By the side of
a mountain road was a large fig-tree, the base of whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
trunk was about thirty feet from the ground. Thence it
reared itself up pillar-like towards the heavens, and
spread abroad its vast horizontal array of branches
across the road. From the same point there descended
to the earth a hollow cone of roots, interwoven and anastomosed,
especially at the upper parts, in the same manner
as those of the boiling-house wall, but forming towards
the bottom only three or four flattened irregular columns.
Into the area inclosed by this network of roots a person
might enter, for it was about six feet wide, and, looking
up, behold the base of the trunk eight or ten yards above
his head.</p>

<p>The explanation of this curious phenomenon depends
upon the tendency just mentioned. On this site once
stood a large tree of some other species, probably a cotton-tree
(<i>Eriodendron</i>), or some other soft-timbered kind.
The little scarlet berry of a Fig-tree was carried by some
vagrant Banana-bird or Pigeon to its boughs, and there
devoured. After the little truant had finished his morsel,
he perhaps wiped his beak against the rough bark
of the trunk, beside the branch on which he was seated.
Some of the minute seeds, enveloped in mucilage, were
thus left on the tree, which the rain presently washed
down into the broad concavity of the forks, where, among
moss and rotten leaves, it soon germinated and grew.
The roots gradually crept down the trunk of the supporting
tree, closely clinging to its bark, and by their interlacement
at length formed a living case, enveloping it on
every side, and penetrating the earth around its base.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
The growth of these, and also of the inclosed tree, daily
induced a tighter and tighter pressure on the latter,
which at length arrived at such a degree as to stop the
circulation of the sap between the bark and the wood.
Death, of course, was the result, and speedy decay reduced
the supporting tree to a heap of mouldering dust: while
the parasite, now able to maintain its own position by
its hollow cone of roots, increased in size and strength,
and overtopped its fellows of the forest;&mdash;<i>a tree standing
upon stilts</i>.</p>

<p>A few years ago I was struck with the appearance of
an East Indian species of the same genus in one of the
conservatories at Kew. Three shoots had run up the
wall, clinging so close, that the leaves looked as if they
were actually glued to the bricks, one over the other,
in the most regular manner. Yet, on examination, I saw
that the leaves did not adhere at all; the only support
was that of the tiny rootlets which proceeded laterally
from each stem, which the leaves concealed. The appearance
of the whole was so curious, with the pale growing
bud peeping out from beneath the topmost leaf, that I
was greatly attracted by it. The base of the plant was
in a pot, but the attendant informed me that this connexion
was about to be cut off, by severing each shoot at
the point where it first seized the wall. The leaves above
this point, by their superior size and vigour, shewed that
the plant was already independent of its pot, and that it
was capable of supporting itself, like a proper air-plant,
by imbibition from the atmosphere alone, needing nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
more than support in its upright position, which it obtained
from the wall by its clinging aerial rootlets.</p>

<p>Every one who has wandered in a primeval forest of
the tropics, whether in the eastern or the western hemisphere,
has been struck by the inconceivable profusion of
the climbers and twiners with which the trees are laced
together. They are found from the thickness of a warship's
cable to that of pack-thread; the stronger ones
often uncouthly twisted together, and binding tree to tree.
They are of the orders <i>Malpighace&aelig;</i>, <i>Apocyane&aelig;</i>, <i>Asclepiade&aelig;</i>,
<i>Bignoniace&aelig;</i>, &amp;c., and often are adorned with the
most brilliant flowers.</p>

<p>I have before cited descriptions of these wonderful
lianes, as they occur in the forests of South America; my
readers may like to peruse Sir Emerson Tennent's graphic
sketch of those of Ceylon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the trees of older and loftier growth that exhibit
the rank luxuriance of these wonderful epiphytes in the
most striking manner. They are tormented by climbing
plants of such extraordinary dimensions that many of
them exceed in diameter the girth of a man; and these
gigantic appendages are to be seen surmounting the tallest
trees in the forest, grasping their stems in firm convolutions,
and then flinging their monstrous tendrils over the
larger limbs till they reach the top, whence they descend
to the ground in huge festoons, and, after including
another and another tree in their successive toils, they
once more ascend to the summit, and wind the whole
into a maze of living network as massy as if formed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
the cable of a line-of-battle ship. When, by and by, the
trees on which this singular fabric has become suspended
give way under its weight, or sink by their own decay,
the fallen trunk speedily disappears, while the convolutions
of climbers continue to grow on, exhibiting one of
the most marvellous and peculiar living mounds of confusion
that it is possible to fancy. Frequently one of
these creepers may be seen holding by one extremity the
summit of a tall tree, and grasping with the other an
object at some distance near the earth, between which it
is strained as tight and straight as if hauled over a block.
In all probability the young tendril had been originally
fixed in this position by the wind, and retained in it till
it had gained its maturity, where it has the appearance
of having been artificially arranged as if to support a
falling tree."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Leaving the vegetable world, we may find some very
curious examples of parasitism among Insects. Every
one who has paid the slightest attention to this class of
animals is aware that there are slender flies called <i>Ichneumons</i>,
whose grubs are hatched and reared in the
bodies of other insects. Many of these have the ovipositor
greatly lengthened, and projecting like a very slender
needle from the extremity of the abdomen. In some species,
this needle-like organ is three or four times the entire
length of the body; and this great longitude is intended
to reach the pup&aelig; of wasps and similar insects which inhabit
deep holes. The needle itself is well worthy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>study. It is not simple, but composed of two pieces forming
a sheath, which open and reveal a central finer filament,
furnished at its tip (in <i>Pimpla manifestator</i>, for
example) with saw-like teeth. With this instrument,
which possesses great elasticity and flexibility, the insect
works, as a carpenter with his brad-awl, boring through
the clay, with which the wasp has closed up the hole
that contains her grub, until the tip of the ovipositor
reaches the soft body of the insect. Into this it pierces,
and deposits an egg, and is withdrawn. The slight puncture
is scarcely felt by the grub, which continues to eat
and grow; the inserted egg, however, presently hatches,
and produces the ichneumon-grub, which begins to feed
on the fat of the wasp-grub, instinctively avoiding the
vital parts, until the latter has attained nearly its full
size, and is ready to pass into the pupa state; when, its
vigour being gone, it fails to accomplish the metamorphosis,
the insidious intruder, now also full grown, taking its
place, and by and by issuing from the hole a perfect Ichneumon.</p>

<p>How often has the enthusiastic young entomologist
been subjected to sore disappointment by the parasitic
habits of these <i>Ichneumonid&aelig;</i>! He has obtained some
fine caterpillar, a great rarity, and by dint of much searching
of his Westwood or his Stainton, feels quite certain
that it is the larva of some much-prized butterfly. He
ascertains its leaf-food; which it eats promisingly; all
goes on encouragingly. Surely it cannot be far from the
pupa state now! When some morning he is horrified to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
behold, instead of the chrysalis, a host of filthy little
grubs eating their way out of the skin of his beautiful
caterpillar, or covering its remains with their tiny yellow
cocoons.</p>

<p>Some of these parasites are so minute that their young
are hatched and reared in the <i>eggs</i> of other insects.
Bonnet found that the egg of a butterfly, itself no bigger
than the head of a minikin pin, was inhabited by several
of the stranger grubs; for out of twenty such eggs, he
says, "a prodigious quantity" of the grubs were evolved.</p>

<p>A very interesting tribe of insects, so diverse from all
other known forms as to constitute an order among themselves,
that of the <i>Strepsiptera</i>, passes its youth in the
bodies of certain wild bees. Mr Kirby's account of his
first detection of one of these, though often quoted, is so
interesting that I must cite it afresh. "I had previously
observed," he remarks, "upon bees something that I took
to be a kind of mite (<i>Acarus</i>), which appeared to be
immovably fixed just at the inosculations of the dorsal
segments of the abdomen. At length, finding three or
four upon an <i>Andr&aelig;na nigro&aelig;nea</i>, I determined not to
lose the opportunity of taking one off to examine and
describe; but what was my astonishment when, upon my
attempting to disengage it with a pin, I drew forth from
the body of the bee a white fleshy larva, a quarter of an
inch in length, the head of which I had mistaken for an
acarus (<i>bee louse</i>)! After I had examined one specimen,
I attempted to extract a second; and the reader may
imagine how greatly my astonishment was increased,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
when, after I had drawn it out but a little way, I saw its
skin burst, and a head as black as ink, with large staring
eyes and antenn&aelig;, consisting of two branches, break forth,
and move itself quickly from side to side. It looked like
a little imp of darkness just emerged from the infernal
regions. My eagerness to set free from its confinement
this extraordinary animal may be easily conjectured.
Indeed, I was impatient to become better acquainted
with so singular a creature. When it was completely
disengaged, and I had secured it from making its escape,
I set myself to examine it as accurately as possible; and
I found, after a careful inquiry, that I had got a nondescript,
whose very class seemed dubious."</p>

<p>Mr Newman, in an essay of much value,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> has shewn
that the larv&aelig; of this tribe of insects are born alive, that
they attach themselves to the abdomens of wild bees,
nestling among the hair, and that they are thus introduced
into the nest of the bee. Here it is somewhat uncertain
how they are sustained at first, for at this time
the bee-grubs are not hatched; probably they remain
without food for some days, or devour a portion of the
pollen and honey stored up. As soon, however, as the
bee-grub is hatched, the Stylops-larva undergoes a metamorphosis,
sheds its six legs, and becomes a footless
maggot; it pierces the soft skin of the bee-grub, and
feeds on its juices, till its maturity, as the Ichneumon on
the body of the caterpillar.</p>

<p>When the perfect bee emerges in the following spring,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>it bears the full-grown Stylops, protruding from the rings
of its abdomen. The latter is in pupa, all the organs
being distinct and separate, but wrapped together, and
inclosed in separate pellicles; very soon, it emerges, as described
by Kirby, and escapes, leaving a great unsightly
cavity in the body of the bee. This is the male: the
female never escapes, but lays its eggs on the bee in
which it has been reared, and then dies.</p>

<p>In the spring we frequently see among herbage a great
uncouth beetle of a dark blue-black hue, with short wing-cases
and long, heavy body, which discharges drops of
yellow fluid when handled, and is therefore called the
Oil-beetle (<i>Mel&ouml;e proscarab&aelig;us</i>). The early stages of
this beetle have much affinity with those of the <i>Stylops</i>.
The beetle lays a number of yellow eggs in a hole in the
earth; these produce little active six-footed larv&aelig;, resembling
lice, which crawl to the summit of dandelion and
other flowers in the sunshine, and await the visit of a bee.
On the arrival of one, the active grub immediately clings to
its body, and is carried to the nest, not, however, to introduce
itself parasitically into the body of the bee-grub, but
to feed on the provision which the parent bee has stored
up for its own young. Thus it becomes very fat, and
grows to a size much larger than that of the full-grown
bee-grub, having early dropped its six long clinging legs,
which, having performed their proper function in catching
hold of a bee, are no longer needed. It changes to a perfect
beetle in autumn, lies in the bee's nest all the winter,
and emerges in the spring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>The large jelly-like Medus&aelig; which in summer are seen
floating around our coasts, driving themselves along by
alternate contractions and expansions of their umbrella,
are frequently infested by little creatures of widely different
organisation, Crustaceans belonging to the genera
<i>Hyperia and Metoecus</i>. On the beautiful <i>Chrysaora</i> of
the southern coast I have seen the <i>Metoecus medusarum</i>,
a little shrimp about half-an-inch in length, with enormous
lustrous green eyes, which takes up his residence in
the cavities of the sub-umbrella,&mdash;dwelling in them as in
so many spacious and commodious apartments, of which
he takes possession, evidently without asking leave of the
landlord, or paying him even the compliment of a peppercorn
rent. Here he snugly ensconces himself, and feels
so much at home, that he is not afraid to leave his dwelling
now and then, to take a swim in the free water, returning
to his chamber after his exercise; and here he
rears his numerous family, which, in the form of tiny
white specks, very much unlike their parents in shape,
stud the membranes of the jelly-fish.</p>

<p>But, what is stranger still, Mr M'Cready has recently
discovered in the harbour of Charleston in North America,
a <i>Medusa</i> which is parasitic upon another <i>Medusa</i>.
<i>Cunina octonaria</i> does not swim freely in the water,
but inhabits the cavity of the bell of <i>Turritopsis nutricula</i>.
"Not only does the latter furnish a shelter
and dwelling-place for the larv&aelig; during their development;
it also serves as their nurse, by allowing the
parasites, whilst adhering by their tentacles, to draw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
nourishment out of its mouth by means of a large proboscis.
In point of fact, the relation between them is of
so unprecedented a nature, that the author may well be
excused for having at first taken the impudent parasite
for the gemmiparous progeny of the sheltering Medusa.
The youngest state of this parasitic Medusa observed by
the author formed a ciliated body of clavate form, adhering
to the cavity of the bell by means of the slender
stalk in which it terminated. The first change consists in
the emission, from the thick end, of two slender flexible
tentacles, and in the formation of a central cavity by
liquefaction. At this stage of development, the author frequently
observed gemmation taking place at the thicker end,
sometimes frequently repeated. Subsequently the number
of tentacles becomes doubled. These bend together over
the clavate extremity, and are then employed, instead of
the thin end of the body, in adhering to the cavity of the
sheltering Medusa. The thin extremity then acquires a
mouth, and may be recognised as a stomachal peduncle,
which is employed, as above indicated, in obtaining
nourishment. The morphological nature of the proboscis
becomes still more distinct when, after the lapse of some
little time, an annular fold makes its appearance immediately
under the tentacles, which is recognisable
from its form, and from the formation in it of (eight)
otolithic capsules, as the first indication of the future bell.
Simultaneously with the otolithic capsules, four rudimentary
tentacles make their appearance between the four
tentacles. The Medusa remains in this stage of develop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>ment
for a long time. The bell gradually becomes more
freely developed, and at last, by the reduction and entire
disappearance of the stomachal peduncle, becomes the
most essential part of the Medusa, after it has left its
previous dwelling-place in the bell of the <i>Turritopsis</i>.
The bell nevertheless retains for some time its earlier
lobed form and unequal tentacles."<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>More remarkable even than this association is the fact
that certain true Fishes habitually reside in the stomachs
of star-fishes. This circumstance, which had been observed
in the Oriental Archipelago by MM. Quoy and
Gaimard, and by Dr Bleeker, has recently been confirmed
by Dr Doleschall, who has written a very interesting
Memoir on it.</p>

<p>This learned naturalist states that the fact of the connexion
between the fish and the star-fish is well known
to most of the fishermen in Amboyna, and that he was
able to obtain a sufficiency of specimens for examination;
but as the star-fishes (and with them the fishes) speedily died
in confinement, he was unable to make continuous observations
upon them in a living state. Of the results of
his observations he gives the following summary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fish stands to the star-fish in a definite relation
which cannot be the object of observation. Why the
little fish should always seek the stomachal cavity of one
and the same species of star-fish, and not that of various
species, is a mystery. It is well known that Crustaceans
of the genus <i>Pagurus</i> inhabit the empty shells of Mol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>lusca;
but we find on the shore the same species of
<i>Pagurus</i> in the shells of the most various genera and
species.</p>

<p>"I have never met with <i>Oxybeles gracilis</i>, on the
contrary, in any other species of star-fish than <i>Culcita
discoidea</i>. The fish was described by Bleeker under the
above name in 'Natuurkundig Tijdschrift,' vii., p. 162.
The author proceeds to state that neither he nor any one
else in Amboyna has ever captured the fish under other
circumstances, or while swimming freely in the sea; but
upon this Dr Bleeker remarks that many of his specimens
of <i>Fierasfer Brandesii</i>, and all those of <i>Fierasfer (Oxybeles)
gracilis</i> and <i>F. lumbricoides</i>, were obtained by him
along with other fishes, and were probably taken while
swimming freely in the sea.</p>

<p>"Upon the habits of <i>Oxybeles gracilis</i> the author goes
on to say that it is certain that this animal passes the
greater part of its existence in the stomach of the star-fish,
rarely shewing itself outside of this, and then probably
at night. That it does come out occasionally,
appears from the fact that in two cases the author
observed the fish with a portion of its body outside the
cavity of the star-fish, and in the act of creeping in.</p>

<p>"The same observations shewed that the fish, in returning
to its concealment, passes along the furrow of the lower
surface of one of the arms leading to the mouth of the
star-fish, which is wide enough, when the tentacles are
retracted, to leave room for the passage of the slender
body of the <i>Oxybeles</i>. This fact likewise proves that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
<i>Oxybeles</i> does not get into the stomach of the <i>Culcita</i> by
accident.</p>

<p>"If a living <i>Culcita</i> be cut in two, the fish is seen moving
freely in the cavity of its body. If it be taken out, it
immediately seeks the shade. If the two halves of the
<i>Culcita</i> (still alive) be placed in the water, the fish will
soon be seen to draw towards them, in order to get into
the cavity of the star-fish. When exposed to the light,
it is uneasy, and its iris contracts excessively. The author
never found two fishes in the same star-fish.</p>

<p>"In most of the fishes examined by him, the author
found the stomach empty; it was full only in one. The
contents of the stomach had the appearance of a lump of
fat, and consisted of half-digested muscle. Under the
microscope, striated muscular fibres could be detected, and
the author thinks that they belonged to the muscles of a
fish. This circumstance proves that <i>Oxybeles</i> does not
feed upon the chyle of the star-fish, but that its nourishment
is analogous to that of other fishes. Whether it
seizes upon the fishes taken by the star-fish for its own
nourishment must be determined by further investigations.</p>

<p>"The author's observations establish&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. That <i>Oxybeles gracilis</i> is not a true parasite.</p>

<p>"2. That it passes the greater part of its life in the
stomach of <i>Culcita discoidea</i>, as is also indicated by the
unusually pale colour of the fish.</p>

<p>"3. That, however, it can come out, either to seek
nourishment, or for the purpose of reproduction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>"4. That it returns to the mouth along the furrow on
the ventral surface of the arms.</p>

<p>"5. That it is very sensitive to light.</p>

<p>"6. That it feeds upon other animals.</p>

<p>"In fresh water the animals live for about half-an-hour.
The pigment upon the peritoneum exhibits under the
microscope the most beautiful stellate forms. The fish
possesses a swimming-bladder."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Some very curious instances of parasitism occur, in
which one kind of creature compels or induces another
creature to labour for its special benefit. Indeed, in all
cases, the parasite is benefited by the functions of the
supporter; but, in the cases I refer to, the slavery is more
special and more apparent.</p>

<p>There is a large species of Crab (<i>Dromia</i>) found in the
West Indies, which is invariably found covered with a
dense mass of sponge. The sponge is found to have
grown in such a manner as to fit every prominence and
cavity of the crab, exactly as if a plastic material had
been moulded on it, yet it is not adherent to it, but is
merely held in position by the hindmost pair of feet,
which in this genus of crabs, are turned upwards, and
apparently serve no other purpose than that of hooks to
hold on the sponge <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>On our own shores we are familiar with the Hermit
crabs making use of various kinds of univalve shells as
houses to protect their softer hindparts; but in many of
these cases there is a third party in the transaction, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>is made to work for the crab's especial advantage. The
shell of the mollusk is sometimes covered with a sort of
fleshy polype-mass (<i>Hydractinia echinata</i>), which is parasitic
on the shell. The shell, however, being tenanted also
by the active crab, the polype, as it grows, moulds itself
on the crab's body, and thus extends the dimensions of its
house, so that it has no necessity either to enlarge its
dwelling by the absorption of part of the interior shell-wall,
or to leave this shell and search for one of ampler
size, as other Hermit-crabs are obliged to do who have
not the advantage of so accommodating a fellow-lodger.
"One can understand," says Dr Gray, "that the Crab may
have the instinct to search for shells, on which the coral
[polype] has begun to grow; but this will scarcely explain
why we never find the [polype] except on shells in which
Hermit-crabs have taken up their residence."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Small Annelids and Crustaceans not unfrequently burrow
into the stony walls of corals; but Dr Gray records a
much more uncommon case, from the Guilding collection.
"It is an expanded coral, which forms a thin surface on
the top of another coral, and is furnished with a number
of small, depressed, horizontal cases, opening with an
oblong mouth. Some of these contain within them a
small, free, crustaceous animal, a <i>Cymothoa</i>, which nearly
fits the case; and it is evident that, by their moving backwards
and forwards on the surface, they have caused the
animal of the coral to form one of these cases for the protection
of each specimen."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>
<p>The manner in which this result is obtained is thus
explained&mdash;"The animals which form their habitation in
corals, appear to begin their domicile in the same way as
the barnacles before referred to; they take advantage of
the soft and yielding nature of the animals which form
the corals, &amp;c., and taking up a lodgement in their body,
all they have to do is to keep a clear passage in it, either
by the moving backwards and forwards, the exertion of
their limbs, or the ingress or egress of water to and from
their bodies, and in time, as the coral is secreted by the
animal, it will form a wall round them; but if, by any
accident, the parasite animal should not keep a passage
from the coral to the surface of the body of the animal
clear, which it must be constantly induced to do, since by
this means it procures food, the coral animal will in a very
short time close over it and bury it alive in the mass of
the coral; and this, from the number of these animals, of
all sizes and in different stages of growth, which are to
be found in the substance of the large and massive corals,
must often be occurring. Thus the Italian romance is
often literally fulfilled in nature."</p>

<p>Certain birds are parasitic, in this sense, that they compel
or induce other birds to perform the labour of incubation
and of rearing their young. The Rhea or Ostrich of
South America is parasitical on its own species; the
females laying each several eggs in the nests of several
other females, and the male ostrich taking all the cares of
incubation. More familiar examples, however, occur in
our own Cuckoo, and in the Cowpen birds (<i>Molothrus</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
<i>pecoris</i> and <i>M. niger</i>) of North and South America.
"These fasten themselves," as has been remarked by Mr
Swainson, "on another living animal, whose animal heat
brings their young into life, whose food they live upon,
and whose death would cause theirs during the period of
infancy."</p>

<p>The habit, at least in the case of the European Cuckoo,
is so well known, that I need not do more than merely
allude to the fact, that the female seeks for the nests of
other insect-eating birds, always much smaller than itself,
and deposits its own eggs,&mdash;a single egg in each; that
this stranger egg is hatched by the foster-mother with all
care, and the young bird is nurtured with all tenderness
even at the expense of its own proper eggs and young,
which in general are sacrificed in the course of the process.
Every schoolboy knows these facts, but few perhaps have
ever suspected the existence of a romantic feeling of love
and fealty in the little bird towards the cuckoo herself,
prompting the rendering of the service required as a
coveted honour. Yet a naturalist has communicated to
Mr Yarrell some facts which certainly look this way; and
because they are indubitably the very romance of natural
history, I cite them, leaving my readers to judge of their
value.</p>

<p>"As you have contributed," writes Mr W. C. Newby of
Stockton, "so much to the information and amusement of
the numerous class of readers who take an interest in subjects
of natural history, I consider it my duty to communicate
first to you, what appears to me a new fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>in the habits and character of that general favourite the
cuckoo.</p>

<p>"An egg of this bird was brought to me on the 6th instant,
which had been taken from the nest of the yellow
bunting, at a short distance from this town, and the boy
who got the egg gave the following account, which, I
think, may be relied on. When bird-nesting the previous
Saturday, he found a nest of the gold spink (a local name
for the yellow bunting) with the young birds just hatched.
On visiting the nest the following day, he flushed the old
bird, having seen her sitting on it, but the young birds
were all excluded, and were lying dead near; and to his
surprise, a single egg&mdash;the one he brought to me&mdash;occupied
the place of the callow brood. He took away the egg
(which is now in my possession) so that it is impossible to
corroborate the statement in any degree. The above circumstance
was first named to me by Tom Green, a well-known
character and naturalist in this town, whom I have
always found to be accurate in his observations on birds,
and by him I was referred to the boy. On my objecting
to Green that the accident appeared incredible, because
unnatural, and contrary to strong parental instinct,
he replied, "Ay, sir, but little birds are mightily ta'en up
with a cuckoo; they'll awmost dee out for them;" and
he related the following fact which came under his own
observation. When out with his gun, collecting birds to
stuff, (animal-preserving being one of his many trades), he
shot at and wounded a cuckoo, which, after flying some
distance, fell upon a hedge with its wings outstretched:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
the attendant bird, which in this case was one of the pipits,
continued in the flight of its patron after the shot, and
when Green approached, he found it sitting on the body
of the dead cuckoo.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>"It has been supposed by some, that small birds follow
the cuckoo for the sake of annoyance, mistaking it for a
sparrow-hawk, to give public notice of a pirate abroad, and
to warn all peaceful subjects of the air against a common
danger. But this is clearly not so, for the flight and cries
clearly distinguish the feelings in the two cases. The attendance
on the cuckoo is at a distance, silent and respectful;
but in the other we have a sort of hue and cry raised,
as it were, against a felon, and which is kept up from
place to place, if not to the shame, at least to the discomfiture
of the culprit.</p>

<p>"The cuckoo is certainly a favourite with them; as Green
says, 'they, (the lesser birds,) are mightily ta'en up with
it;' but to what it owes its influence with its parasites I
leave to you and other philosophical naturalists to determine:
I am content to relate, in simple terms, an interesting
fact."</p>

<p>There is so much analogy with these cuckoo-proceedings
in the habits of Ants, that, although these cannot
correctly be designated as parasites, the details of their
manners will not be wholly out of place, in winding up
this chapter. I refer to the propensity manifested by certain
species of ants to make slaves of the workers of another
species, leading them into captivity and compelling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>them to labour for the benefit of the marauders. Strangely
enough, the parallel between the human and the formican
slave-trade holds to this further extent that, so far as we
know, the kidnappers are red or pale-coloured ants, and
the slaves, like true <i>niggers</i>, are black.</p>

<p>The slave-hunting expeditions are planned and executed
with the utmost skill and courage. "When the red ants
are about to sally forth on a marauding expedition, they
send scouts to ascertain the exact position in which a colony
of negroes may be found; these scouts, having discovered
the object of their search, return to the nest, and report
their success. Shortly afterwards the army of red
ants marches forth, headed by a vanguard which is perpetually
changing; the individuals which constitute it,
when they have advanced a little before the main body,
halting, falling into the rear, and being replaced by others:
this vanguard consists of eight or ten ants only.</p>

<p>"When they have arrived near the negro colony, they
disperse, wandering through the herbage and hunting
about, as if aware of the propinquity of the object of their
search, yet ignorant of its exact position. At last they
discover the settlement, and the foremost of the invaders
rushing impetuously to the attack, are met, grappled with,
and frequently killed by the negroes on guard; the alarm
is quickly communicated to the interior of the nest; the
negroes sally forth by thousands, and the red ants rushing
to the rescue, a desperate conflict ensues, which, however,
always terminates in the defeat of the negroes, who retire
to the inmost recesses of their habitation. Now follows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
the scene of pillage; the red ants, with their powerful
mandibles, tear open the sides of the negro ant-hill, and
rush into the heart of the citadel. In a few minutes each
of the invaders emerges, carrying in its mouth the pupa
of a worker negro, which it has obtained in spite of the
vigilance and valour of its natural guardians. The red
ants return in perfect order to their nest, bearing with
them their living burdens. On reaching the nest the pup&aelig;
appear to be treated precisely as their own, and the
workers, when they emerge, perform the various duties of
the community with the greatest energy and apparent
good will; they repair the nest, excavate passages, collect
food, feed the larv&aelig;, take the pup&aelig; into the sun-shine,
and perform every office which the welfare of the colony
seems to require; in fact, they conduct themselves entirely
as if fulfilling their original destination."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>ON THE SEA-SERPENT.</h3>


<p>Since the publication of my former volume, which concluded
with an examination of the evidence for the existence of this
unrecognised animal, two other important testimonies have been
brought under my notice. The first of these is that of an officer
of high literary reputation, the Consular representative of Great
Britain lately residing at Boston, in the United States, who thus
gives his personal testimony and that of his lady to the appearance
of the monster:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On a Sunday afternoon in the middle of August, above a
hundred persons, at that time in and about the hotel, were called
on to observe an extraordinary appearance in the sea, at no great
distance from the shore. Large shoals of small fish were rushing
landwards in great commotion, leaping from the water, crowding
on each other, and shewing all the common symptoms of flight
from the pursuit of some wicked enemy. I had already more
than once remarked this appearance from the rocks, but in a
minor degree; and on these occasions I could always distinguish
the shark, whose ravages among the "manhaidens" was the
cause of such alarm. But the particular case in question was
far different from those. The pursuer of the fugitive shoals
soon became visible; and that it was a huge marine monster,
stretching to a length quite beyond the dimensions of an ordinary
fish, was evident to all the observers. No one, in short,
had any doubt as to its being the sea-serpent, or one of the
species to which the animal or animals so frequently before seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
belonged. The distance at which this one was, for ten minutes
or a quarter of an hour, visible, made it impossible to give a
description of its apparent dimensions so accurate as to carry
conviction to the sceptical. For us who witnessed it, it was
enough to be convinced that the thing was a reality. But one
of the spectators, Dr Amos Binney, a gentleman of scientific
attainments, drew up a minute account of it, which is deposited
in the archives of one of the Philosophical Societies of Boston.
I was and am quite satisfied that on this occasion I had a partial
and indistinct but positive view of this celebrated nondescript.
But had the least doubt rested on my mind, it would have been
entirely removed by the event of the day following the one just
recorded. On that day, a little before noon, my wife was sitting,
as was her wont, reading on the upper piazza of the hotel. She
was alone. The gentlemen, including myself and my son, were,
as usual, absent at Boston, and the ladies were scattered about
in various directions. She was startled by a cry from the house
of "The sea-serpent! The sea-serpent!" But this had been so
frequent, by the way of joke, since the event of the preceding
day, and was so like "The wolf, the wolf!" of the fable, that it
did not attract her particular attention for a moment or two,
until she observed two women belonging to the family of the
hotel-keeper running along the piazza towards the corner nearest
the sea, with wonder in their eyes, and the cry of "The serpent,
the serpent! He is turning, he is turning!" spontaneously
bursting from their lips. Then my wife did fix her looks in the
direction they ran; and sure enough she saw, apparently quite
close beyond the line formed by the rising ground above the
rocks, a huge serpent, gliding gracefully through the waves,
having evidently performed the action of turning round. In an
instant it was in a straight line, moving rapidly on; and after
coasting for a couple of minutes the north-west front of the
hotel, and (as accurately as the astonished observer could calculate)
looking as it stretched at full length in the water about the
length of the piazza, that is to say, about ninety feet; it sank
quietly beneath the surface, and was seen no more.</p>

<p>"The person who was thus so lucky as to get this unobstructed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
view, is one so little liable to be led astray by any imaginary impulse,
that I reckon on her statement with entirely as much
confidence as if my own eyes had demonstrated its truth."&mdash;<i>Grattan's
Civilised America</i>, p. 39.</p>

<p>The second testimony is contained in the following communication
with which I have been favoured by Mr Cave:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">
35, <span class="smcap">Wilton Place</span>, <i>April 29, 1861</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;On reading your interesting "Romance of Natural History"
it occurred to me that I could supply some corroborative
evidence of the existence of the sea serpent. On looking up my
old journals, I found it was slighter than I imagined; but, such
as it is, I give it almost verbatim from my diary.</p>

<p>I was in Jamaica the year after you were, and have often regretted
that we were not there together, as I might have shewn
you parts of the island which you missed, and have been, perhaps,
the cause of a few more pages to your very pleasant journal
of a naturalist there.&mdash;Believe me, faithfully, yours,</p>

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">Philip H. Gosse, Esq.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Extract from a Journal written during a Voyage to the West
Indies in 1846.</i></p>

<p><i>Thursday, Dec. 10.</i>&mdash;Off Madeira, on board R.M.S. "Thames."&mdash;"Made
acquaintance with a Captain Christmas of the Danish
navy, a proprietor in Santa Cruz, and holding some office about
the Danish Court. He told me he once saw a sea-serpent between
Iceland and the Faroe Islands. He was lying-to in a gale
of wind, in a frigate of which he had the command, when an immense
shoal of porpoises rushed by the ship, as if pursued; and,
lo and behold! a creature with a neck moving like that of a swan,
about the thickness of a man's waist, with a head like a horse,
raised itself slowly and gracefully from the deep, and seeing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
ship it immediately disappeared again, head foremost, like a duck
diving. He only saw it for a few seconds; the part above the
water seemed about 18 feet in length. He is a singularly intelligent
man, and by no means one to allow his imagination to run
away with him."</p>

this animal ever discovered, was exhumed in 1849 at Killowen, in Co.
Wexford. It was buried <i>only four feet below the surface</i>, between the
vegetable mould and plastic clay. The roots of the black willow and
German rush had entwined themselves round the bones, and some
seeds, ascertained to be those of the wild cabbage, were found in the
same bed. The dimensions of the skeleton were as follows:&mdash;Height,
12&#189; feet to the tips of the horns, 7 feet to the top of the pelvis; expanse
of horns 11 feet in a chord, or 13 feet 6 inches along the curve; palm
of the antlers 2 feet 7 inches long by 1 foot 5 inches broad, some of the
snags 2 feet 6 inches long; the face 1 foot 10&#189; inches in length.</p></div>

quadruped or bird, which inhabited the woods. But that the <i>Simi&aelig;</i>, or
monkey tribe, were not likely to have at any time inhabited so cold a
country, one would have seen in the term an exceedingly apt expression
for "the wild man of the woods." (Note by Translator.)

But, I venture to remind the reader, there was a veritable ape found
in Britain during the very era of the Giant Deer, and of many of the now
extant animals. I refer to the <i>Macacus plioc&aelig;nus</i> (Owen) of the fresh-water
deposits. Is it not just possible that the <i>Geilt</i> of Ireland, the
first-named animal in the poem, may have been this species? A <i>Macacus</i>
still lingers in Europe, though the elephants and hippopotamuses have

Animal Remains belonging to the Royal Irish Academy," read before
the Academy on the 9th and 25th of May, 1859, to which I am indebted
for the foregoing poem, cites the following legend, which we
might have referred to the <i>Megaceros</i>, but that he appears to consider
the animal in question the Red Deer or Stag:&mdash;"On another occasion
St Patrick and his retinue, with Cailte MacRonain, came to the house
of a rich landholder who lived in the southern part of the present
County of Kildare, near the river Slaney. The farmer complained to
Cailte that although he sowed a great quantity of corn every year, it
yielded him no profit, on account of <i>a huge wild Deer</i> which every
year came across the Slaney from the west when the corn was ripe
for cutting, and, rushing through it in all directions, trampled it down
under his feet. Cailte undertook to relieve him, and he sent into
Munster for his seven deer-nets, which arrived in due time. He then
went out and placed his men and his hounds in the paths through
which the great deer was accustomed to pass, and he set his deer-nets
upon the cliffs, passes, and rivers around, and when he saw the animal
coming to the Ford of the Red Deer on the river Slaney, he took his
spear and cast a fortunate throw at him, driving it the length of a man's
arm out through the opposite side; and 'The Red Ford of the Great
Deer' is the name of that pass on the Slaney ever since; and they
brought him back to Drom Lethan, or 'The Broad Hill,' which is called
'The Broad Hill of the Great Wild Deer.'"</p></div>

our conservatories. It is generally stated to be a native of the East
Indies, but the one spoken of by Tschudi, with a Peruvian name, must
certainly be an indigenous plant of the country.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_186_186" id="Footnote_186_186"></a><a href="#FNanchor_186_186"><span class="label">[186]</span></a> The genus <i>Mikania</i> of Willdenow is one of the tubuliflorous <i>Asterace&aelig;</i>.
<i>M. guaco</i> Humboldt mentions, under the name of Vijuco del
Guaco, as being highly esteemed in South America as a valuable antidote
against the bite of serpents. "Guaco" and "huaco" are the same
word, the intensity of the aspirate varying among different peoples.
The power of this <i>Mikania</i> is denied in the most positive terms by
Hancock, who suspects that the real Guaco antidote is some kind of
<i>Aristolochia</i>. The word "Vijuco" or "Bejuco," in Tropical America,
signifies any climbing plant, and is equivalent to our florist word
"creeper."
</p><p>
<i>Eupatorium ayapana</i>, belonging to the same order as <i>Mikania</i>, is a
valuable repellent of the poison of venomous snakes. For this purpose
it is used in Brazil. A quantity of the bruised leaves, which are to be
frequently changed, is laid on the scarified wound, and some spoonfuls
of the expressed juice are from time to time administered to the patient,
till he is found to be free from the symptoms, especially the dreadful
anxiety which follows the wounds of venomous reptiles. <i>E. perfoliatum</i>
has a very similar action, and <i>Mikania opifera</i> is employed in the same
way.&mdash;(<i>Lindley's Veg. Kingd.</i>, p. 707.) These facts tend to confirm the
accuracy of Tschudi and Humboldt against Hancock.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_189_189" id="Footnote_189_189"></a><a href="#FNanchor_189_189"><span class="label">[189]</span></a> Several of the <i>Aristolochie&aelig;</i>&mdash;plants generally having a very bitter
taste, and a strong, pungent, disagreeable smell&mdash;are valuable alexipharmics.
There is a plant very common in Jamaica, where it is called
snake-withe, trailing over the stone fences, which I suspect to be an
<i>Aristolochia</i>, and perhaps <i>A. trilobata</i>; it is employed as a sudden and
potent sudorific, and as an antidote to serpent-bites in other countries,
for in Jamaica there is no venomous reptile. The <i>A. anguicida</i> of Carthagena
is described by Jacquin as fatal to serpents. He says that the
juice of the root chewed and introduced into the mouth of a serpent so
stupefies it that it may be for a long time handled with impunity: if
the reptile is compelled to swallow a few drops, it perishes in convulsions.
The root is also reputed to be an antidote to serpent-bites. "It
is not a little remarkable," observes Dr Lindley, "that the power of
stupefying snakes, ascribed in Carthagena to <i>Aristolochia anguicida</i>,
should be also attributed to <i>A. pallida</i>, <i>longa</i>, <i>b&oelig;tica</i>, <i>sempervirens</i> and
<i>rotunda</i>; which are said to be the plants with which the Egyptian
jugglers stupefy the snakes they play with."</p></div>

<p>OUR CHRISTIAN CLASSICS:</p>

<p>READINGS FROM THE BEST DIVINES.</p>

<p>By JAMES HAMILTON, D.D.</p>

<p>DEDICATED TO THE LORD BISHOP OF LONDON.</p>


<p>Extending from the Reformation to the close of the eighteenth century,
it is the object of this series to give the reader a comprehensive
view of that very various and noble Christian literature by which our
country has been signalised above all others, with biographical and critical
notices of the more distinguished authors.</p>

<p>EXCELSIOR:</p>

<p>HELPS TO PROGRESS IN RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND
LITERATURE.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATED BY CAREFUL DRAWINGS ON WOOD.</p>


<p>As, besides continuous papers on such subjects as Zoology, Meteorology,
British Mining, the Fine Arts, the Human Frame, Church History,
English Letter-Writers, &amp;c., these volumes contain numerous contributions
in the departments of Biography, Adventures and Incidents
of Travel, the Useful Arts, Tales, Poetry, Literary Criticism, Scriptural
Evidences, and Christian Ethics, it is believed that they will be found
a welcome acquisition amongst those who, in their search for amusement,
do not lose sight of instruction. More especially is it respectfully
submitted that, combining so much sound information with the
liveliness of a miscellany, they would find an appropriate place in the
bookcase of the Schoolroom and in the Village Library, as well as on
the shelf beside the Parlour-fire.</p>
